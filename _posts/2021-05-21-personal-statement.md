I learned the importance of data collection and analysis from my father, a lifelong dairy farmer. My passion for coding resulted from my desire to escape the physical work of dairy farming at an early age. From my first "hello world," I was determined to learn how to make computers work for me. It was, however, many years before I realized how important the daily analysis of data performed by my father really was.

After 2 years in college, I made what turned out to be a life changing decision when I enlisted in the United States Air Force. While in the Air Force, I had two courses from the National Cryptologic School specifically for processing and transforming data with code: Bourne Shell Scripting and PERL Programming. As a Signals Intelligence Analyst my job was to analyze data collected over time and report on it. Daily, I processed massive datasets using programs I wrote to transform, analyze, and visualize data. While enlisted in the Air Force, I learned that I have aptitude for analyzing and solving complex problems with data and code. Several of my reports were briefed directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff which garnered special recognition from the Director of the National Security Agency.

Today I serve as the Director of Technology for the Eastern Upper Peninsula Intermediate School District and have the responsibility of analyzing, designing, implementing, and securing complex information systems. These systems collect, store, and transmit the highly sensitive information used to drive decisions related to student achievement. The network and information systems I oversee, collect an unimaginable amount of data, impossible for humans to analyze and protect without the assistance of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Advances in these areas have created an opportunity to modernize my skillset to ensure safe, secure, and exceptionally reliable information systems as well as helping solve our societies greatest challenges.

These experiences and my passion to analyze data to solve problems and help people led me to pursue a graduate degree at the University of Michigan. My career journey has been the constant drive to use computers to solve complex problems. Just as my parents committed themselves to improving agriculture, I am driven to use data and technology to make a difference in the lives of all Michigan residents. The secrets to overcome our greatest challenges lie in the data, computers can work for us to find them. I am proud to be student in the Master of Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan School of Information.
