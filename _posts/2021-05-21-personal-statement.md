I learned the importance of data collection and analysis from my father, a lifelong dairy farmer. My passion for coding resulted from my desire to escape the physical work of dairy farming at an early age.

After 2 years in college, I made what turned out to be a life changing decision when I enlisted in the United States Air Force. While in the Air Force, I had two courses from the National Cryptologic School that introduced me to computer programming and the power of data analysis.

Today I serve as the Director of Technology for the Eastern Upper Peninsula Intermediate School District and have the responsibility of analyzing, designing, implementing, and securing complex information systems.

These experiences and my passion to analyze data to solve problems and help people led me to pursue a graduate degree at the University of Michigan. My career journey has been the constant drive to learn more about data and how to use it to improve the lives of others.
