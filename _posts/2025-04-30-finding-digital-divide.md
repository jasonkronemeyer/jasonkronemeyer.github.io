## Short: Finding the Digital Divide with Bayesian Networks

Author: Jason Kronemeyer - compiled from my data science course / project notes.

In today's interconnected world, the digital divide remains a significant challenge. This gap between those who have access to modern digital technologies and those who do not can have profound imp[...]  

### What Are Bayesian Networks?

Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent a set of variables and their conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). These networks are incredibly useful[...]  

- **Inference**: Predicting the likelihood of certain outcomes based on observed data.
- **Learning**: Updating beliefs based on new evidence.
- **Causal Reasoning**: Understanding the causal relationships between variables.

### Understanding the Digital Divide

The digital divide is influenced by various factors, including:

- **Availability**: Access to internet infrastructure.
- **Aspiration**: The desire and motivation to use digital technologies.
- **Relevance**: Availability of relevant opportunities, skills and literacy.
- **Quality**: The user experience, encompassing the quality, capacity, and reliability of internet connections.
- **Affordability**: Cost of accessing digital technologies.

### Applying Bayesian Networks to the Digital Divide

Bayesian networks can help analyze the digital divide by:

- **Modeling Dependencies**: Representing how different factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, geographic location) influence access to digital technologies.
- **Predicting Outcomes**: Estimating the probability of individuals or communities gaining access to digital technologies based on various interventions.
- **Identifying Key Factors**: Determining which variables have the most significant impact on closing the digital divide.

For instance, imagine a Bayesian network that models the relationship between income levels, education, and internet access. By analyzing this network, policymakers can identify which intervention[...]  

### Conclusion

Bayesian networks offer a robust framework for understanding and addressing the digital divide. By modeling the complex relationships between various factors, we can make more informed decisions a[...]
