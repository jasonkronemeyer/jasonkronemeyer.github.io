As a new generation steps into the workforce, they’re met not by open doors—but by algorithms. Entry-level jobs, once a rite of passage, are increasingly automated. The result? A job market where even college grads are struggling to find footing.

According to the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:unemployment), the unemployment rate for recent college graduates (ages 22–27) has reached its highest point in over a decade, excluding the pandemic.

But there’s hope—and action.

## 💡 Citi Foundation’s $25M Global Innovation Challenge

In response, the Citi Foundation has launched a $25 million initiative to support 50 nonprofits across the globe. Each will receive $500,000 to help young people build the skills they need to thrive in a world transformed by AI.

> “This isn’t about turning everyone into coders,” said Ed Skyler, Head of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs at Citi. “It’s about preparing young people to lead with creativity, empathy, and judgment—skills AI can’t replicate.”

## 🛠️ What the Grants Support

- **Digital literacy & AI fluency**
- **Vocational and technical training**
- **Career mentorship and guidance**
- **Soft skills development** (empathy, communication, critical thinking)

Organizations like [NPower](https://www.npower.org/) and [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/) are expanding programs for “green learners”—those with no tech background—offering pathways into cloud computing, cybersecurity, and project management.

## 🎙️ What This Means for Us

This moment calls for more than training. It calls for storytelling.

In our community work, we can:
- Use narrative formats—comics, podcasts, visual explainers—to demystify AI and empower youth.
- Partner with local schools and nonprofits to amplify these grant-funded programs.
- Reframe the conversation: not “AI vs. humans,” but “AI + human wisdom.”

Let’s help the next generation see themselves not as obsolete—but as irreplaceable.
