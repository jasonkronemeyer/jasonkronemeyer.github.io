## Introduction

If you’re working in K-12 technology, you know the challenges: more devices, more security risks, higher reliability demands, and the constant push for sustainability. In this Panduit webinar, “Capitalizing on Class Four Power in Optical LAN Applications,” brought together experts from Tellabs and Panduit to show how new power and network architectures are changing the game for smart schools.

## Why Smart Schools Need a New Approach

**Scale & Reach:**  
IoT devices are multiplying in classrooms and across campuses. Traditional copper networks struggle to keep up with the density and distance requirements. Fiber-based Passive Optical LAN (POL) can support five times the device density and up to 100 times the reach—think 10, 40, even 100 gigabit speeds.

{% include callout.html type="info" title="What could your community campus reach?" content="With Passive Optical LAN, a single fiber can extend up to 12 miles from the data center—meaning one centralized system could connect multiple school buildings across an entire district. Add Class Four power with its 2-kilometer reach, and you're looking at unified power and network infrastructure that spans the community campus, from elementary schools to high schools to community centers, all managed from one location. **Public Safety Example:** The same fiber infrastructure can carry 800MHz distributed antenna systems (DAS)signals on a separate strand, ensuring first responders have reliable communication throughout your entire campus—a critical requirement for school safety and emergency response." %}

**Security:**  
Every new device is a potential attack surface. POL eliminates legacy Ethernet switches, reducing vulnerabilities and supporting zero trust architectures. Fiber is inherently tough to tap, and centralized management means fewer weak points.

**Reliability:**  
Network downtime disrupts learning and safety. POL, built on carrier-grade tech, delivers five nines (99.999%) reliability, with advanced redundancy options that can push uptime even higher.

**Sustainability:**  
Schools are under pressure to reduce energy use and waste.

When you focus on energy efficiency in school buildings, one big improvement area is reducing the number of conversions between alternating current and direct current. Many modern devices, like LED lights, laptops, and networking equipment, naturally run on DC power. By supplying DC power directly, you eliminate wasteful steps where energy is lost in conversion.

At the same time, designing a smarter network infrastructure, like using passive optical LAN, reduces the energy needed to keep information moving across the campus. Fewer active components mean less power and cooling are required.

POL cuts down on plastics, cooling needs, and landfill impact. Large deployments have shown up to 65% energy savings and millions in operational cost reductions.

**Power Management:**  
Managing power for hundreds of endpoints—projectors, displays, sensors, and more—is a growing challenge. Class Four Fault Managed Power enables safe, long-distance, high-capacity power delivery, supporting the expansion of smart classrooms.

## How Class Four Power Changes the Game

### What is Class Four Power?

Class Four combines the safety of low-voltage systems with the power and reach of high-voltage. Up to 450 volts can be pushed safely over copper, thanks to built-in fault detection and energy limitation. This means you can run power up to two kilometers—perfect for sprawling school campuses.

**Key Standards:**
- NEC Article 726 (2023 code adopted in Michigan)
- UL 1400-1 (systems) & UL 1400-2 (cables)

### How Does It Work in Schools?

- **Backbone:** Class Four power runs from the main electrical room to hallway (edge) IDF cabinets.
- **Edge Distribution:** At the edge, Class Four receivers convert power to Class Two for local distribution—powering classroom devices, lighting, and IoT endpoints.
- **Public Safety:** The same fiber infrastructure supports 800MHz DAS on a dedicated strand, ensuring first responders have communication coverage throughout the campus.
- **Safety:** The system constantly monitors for faults, instantly disabling power if needed and self-healing when safe.

### Practical Deployment

In a school, you might run Class Four to a hallway, then branch off with Class Two to individual classrooms. Each receiver gets a dedicated run for safety and monitoring. This hybrid approach maximizes efficiency and safety, while simplifying backup and maintenance—one Building Energy Storage System (BESS) can cover the whole system.

## Passive Optical LAN: The Smart Network for Schools

POL uses a point-to-multipoint topology:
- **OLT (Optical Line Terminal):** Central controller in the data center.
- **Optical Splitters:** Distribute the signal throughout the building.
- **ONTs (Optical Network Terminals):** Convert fiber to copper for end devices.
- **Centralized Software:** Manages all devices, streamlining operations.

**Benefits for Schools:**
- Centralized management reduces IT workload.
- Fiber infrastructure supports easy upgrades (Wi-Fi 6/7 ready).
- Enhanced security and reliability.
- Significant energy and cost savings.

## Conclusion

Class Four Fault Managed Power and Passive Optical LAN are redefining what’s possible for K-12 schools. They offer the scale, safety, and sustainability needed for modern learning environments. If you’re planning a new build or renovation, it’s time to look beyond traditional power and network designs.
