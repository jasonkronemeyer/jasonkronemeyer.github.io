I live at a 911 service address that previous broadband subsidies never reached. Not because the terrain was too rugged or the technology too new—but because the policy design was flawed. It left communities like mine stranded, waiting for promises that never materialized.

That’s why the NTIA’s recent stance on BEAD funding resonates so deeply. Assistant Secretary Arielle Roth said it plainly:

> *“BEAD projects are inherently risky. These are the hardest-to-serve areas in the country—the ones the private sector didn’t reach even with earlier federal programs. But BEAD is likely to be the last major federal broadband investment—as it should be—and providers that are banking on future subsidies to stay afloat, are setting themselves, and their communities, up to fail.”*

This isn’t just a policy pivot—it’s a reckoning. For those of us who’ve lived through the gaps, the delays, and the excuses, it’s a call to build differently. That means **fund stacking**—leveraging federal, state, local, and philanthropic dollars in concert—and **resource pooling** across agencies, anchor institutions, and private partners. These strategies don’t just stretch budgets; they build resilience.

When public-private partnerships are designed to share risk, align incentives, and invest in community capacity, they become more than deployment vehicles—they become engines of sustained success. BEAD may be the last mile of federal broadband investment. Let’s make sure it’s the first mile of real, lasting connectivity for every community—especially the ones that were forgotten the first time.
