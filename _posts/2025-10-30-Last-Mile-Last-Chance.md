I live at a 911 service address that previous broadband subsidies never reached. Not because the terrain was too rugged or the technology too new—but because the policy design was flawed. It left communities like mine stranded, waiting for promises that never materialized.

All too often, we watched private companies and FCC announcements promoting the latest subsidy that was finally going to serve rural areas—only to see it perpetuate the disadvantage of people with no voice. We are only about 10% of the population of the United States, and the penalties for defaulting were designed in ways that made it seem like private enterprises could take the money and run.

That’s why the NTIA’s recent stance on BEAD funding resonates so deeply. Assistant Secretary Arielle Roth said it plainly:

> *“BEAD projects are inherently risky. These are the hardest-to-serve areas in the country—the ones the private sector didn’t reach even with earlier federal programs. But BEAD is likely to be the last major federal broadband investment—as it should be—and providers that are banking on future subsidies to stay afloat, are setting themselves, and their communities, up to fail.”*

This isn’t just a policy pivot—it’s a reckoning. For those of us who’ve lived through the gaps, the delays, and the excuses, it’s a call to build differently. That means **fund stacking**—leveraging federal, state, local, and philanthropic dollars in concert—and **resource pooling** across agencies, anchor institutions, and private partners. These strategies don’t just stretch budgets; they build resilience.

Through our partnership with the MSU Quello Center and Merit Network’s Michigan Moonshot, we finally had amplification of our local voice through data and policy research. We were blessed to participate in the K–12 Citizen Science project, which helped quantify the effect that poor policy design has on communities with no voice—culminating in the Homework Gap report. Through data and research, our voice was finally loud enough to inform national, state, and local policy.

We talk about BEAD being the largest investment in history. But as a matter of policy and investment, we must recognize that in my region, BEAD really is only the **last 10%** of investment needed to achieve universal availability. I am grateful to the service providers and their investment in my communities—this is how public-private collaboration and policy unite for lasting success of all parties involved.

This will catapult us into the digital economy via the **Fourth Industrial Revolution**, and we will finally be able to aspire all the opportunities that come with it. Marking the end of the perpetual disadvantage we have endured for so long.
