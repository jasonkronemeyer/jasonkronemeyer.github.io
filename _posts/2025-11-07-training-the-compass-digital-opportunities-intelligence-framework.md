In this post, we dive into the training of the COMPASS Digital Opportunities Intelligence Network. This framework is designed to enhance decision-making capabilities by leveraging data-driven insights. We'll explore the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes of this training initiative, to empower individuals and organizations to seize digital opportunities effectively.

### **Project Compass (DOIN): The "Policy Learning Machine"**

**Project Compass** is a next-generation decision support system designed to transform how we understand and solve the digital divide. It moves beyond static maps and spreadsheets to create a dynamic, predictive intelligence engine for digital opportunity.

It consists of three integrated layers:

#### **1. The Compass (The Map)**
*   **Foundation:** Built on the rigorous academic framework (Bauer et al., TPRC 2023) that defines digital opportunity across six dimensions: *Contexts, Governance, Connectivity, Skills, Applications, and Outcomes*.
*   **Purpose:** It ensures we aren't just measuring "access" (wires in the ground) but the actual human impact and opportunity resulting from that access.

#### **2. The Network (The Structure)**
*   **Technology:** A semantic **Knowledge Graph**.
*   **Function:** It ingests and links vast, disparate datasets—census demographics, infrastructure maps, federal policy documents, and local stakeholder feedback.
*   **Result:** Instead of isolated data silos, it creates a web of relationships, allowing us to see how a policy change in one area (e.g., "Skills") might ripple through to another (e.g., "Economic Outcomes").

#### **3. The Intelligence (The Engine)**
*   **Technology:** **Bayesian Networks** and **GraphRAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
*   **Function:** It operationalizes the "Policy Learning Approach."
    *   It uses **Gini coefficients** to measure inequality gaps.
    *   It uses **Hajek estimators** to correct for data biases.
    *   It uses **Bayesian inference** to model cause-and-effect.
*   **Power:** It allows policymakers to ask "What if?" questions. *("If we invest $X in digital literacy here, what is the predicted impact on adoption rates compared to a subsidy?")*

**In Summary:**
While traditional broadband maps tell you **where** the internet is, **DOIN** tells you **how** to maximize the opportunity it creates. It is the navigation system for the Digital Opportunity Compass.
