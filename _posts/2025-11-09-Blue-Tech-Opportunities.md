Michigan, surrounded by the Great Lakes, is uniquely positioned to lead the way in blue tech—a burgeoning industry focused on the sustainable use of water resources for innovation, economic growth, and environmental stewardship. This post presents a framework for strengthening connections between Lake Superior State University (LSSU), Bay Mills Community College (BMCC), and the blue tech industry, creating pathways for students, researchers, and communities in Michigan's Eastern Upper Peninsula.

## The Case for Blue Tech in Michigan
With 84% of North America’s surface freshwater flowing through the Great Lakes, Michigan has unparalleled access to natural water resources. Blue tech presents transformative opportunities in:
- Water purification technologies.
- Renewable energy innovations like offshore wind and hydroelectric power.
- IoT solutions in fisheries and aquatic resource management.
- Logistics, shipping efficiencies, and sustainable aquaculture.

Investments in blue tech don’t just protect our environment—they fuel new industries, diversify the economy, and create high-paying jobs.

## LSSU: Anchoring Freshwater Innovation
Lake Superior State University (LSSU) is a regional leader in blue tech, thanks to its diverse programs and research initiatives:

### Key Initiatives:
1. **AMORE Team (Autonomous Marine Operations & Robotics Engineering):**
   Undergraduate students develop autonomous vessels and technology to monitor freshwater quality, detect oil spills, and study aquatic ecosystems. [Learn more](https://robonation.org/lssu-mathworks-students-blog/)

2. **Invasive Species Research:**
   Collaboration efforts are tackling the invasive European frog-bit plant and its ecological impact on the St. Marys River. Techniques include biological controls, genetic study, and fish population recovery. [Read about their research](https://www.efbcollaborative.net/current-research/)

## BMCC: Connecting Anishinaabe to Blue Tech
Bay Mills Community College (BMCC), a tribal college in Brimley, Michigan, plays an important role in contributing to blue tech through programs that intersect with the field:

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** BMCC’s GIS expertise provides valuable tools for mapping and monitoring Great Lakes ecozones, water systems, and habitats—key areas within the blue tech industry.

- **Community Partnerships:** BMCC’s collaborations—such as the Waganakising Odawa Career and Technical Education Program (WOCTEP)—equip students with skills focusing on sustainability, ecological monitoring, and technology integration, which align with blue tech aspirations.

- **Invasive Species Management:** Leveraging both institutions' expertise to develop technology-driven solutions for invasive species like European frog-bit
- **Climate Change Adaptation:** Studying impacts on Great Lakes ecosystems and tribal lands through collaborative research projects

**Shared Research Infrastructure:**
- Establish remote sensing and data collection stations on BMCC's campus that feed data to LSSU research labs
- Create a shared blue tech equipment pool accessible to faculty and students from both institutions
- Develop joint grant proposals for federal funding (NSF, NOAA, EPA) focused on tribal and rural blue tech innovation

### 3. Industry Partnerships and Workforce Development

**Blue Tech Industry Engagement:**
- Establish a Blue Tech Industry Advisory Board with representatives from both institutions, tribal governments, and regional blue tech companies
- Create industry-sponsored project opportunities where students from both institutions work on real-world challenges
- Develop internship and co-op programs connecting students to blue tech employers in Michigan and across the Great Lakes region
- Host annual Blue Tech Innovation Summits bringing together academia, industry, and community stakeholders

**Skills Training and Certification:**
- Offer stackable credentials that students can earn at BMCC and build upon at LSSU
- Develop micro-credential programs in blue tech specializations (drone operation for environmental monitoring, water quality data analysis, GIS for aquatic resources)
- Create continuing education programs for current workers to upskill in blue tech areas
- Implement competency-based education models allowing students to progress at their own pace

### 4. Digital Equity and Community Engagement
