Michigan, surrounded by the Great Lakes, is uniquely positioned to lead the way in blue tech—a burgeoning industry focused on the sustainable use of water resources for innovation, economic growth, and environmental stewardship. As we explore the potential of blue tech, it’s crucial to consider how regional institutions like Lake Superior State University (LSSU) and Bay Mills Community College (BMCC) contribute to building aspirations for growth in this vital sector.

## The Case for Blue Tech in Michigan
With 84% of North America’s surface freshwater flowing through the Great Lakes, Michigan has unparalleled access to natural water resources. Blue tech presents transformative opportunities in:
- Water purification technologies.
- Renewable energy innovations like offshore wind and hydroelectric power.
- IoT solutions in fisheries and aquatic resource management.
- Logistics, shipping efficiencies, and sustainable aquaculture.

Investments in blue tech don’t just protect our environment—they fuel new industries, diversify the economy, and create high-paying jobs.

## LSSU: Anchoring Freshwater Innovation
Lake Superior State University (LSSU) is a regional leader in blue tech, thanks to its diverse programs and research initiatives:

### Key Initiatives:
1. **AMORE Team (Autonomous Marine Operations & Robotics Engineering):**
   Undergraduate students develop autonomous vessels and technology to monitor freshwater quality, detect oil spills, and study aquatic ecosystems. [Learn more](https://robonation.org/lssu-mathworks-students-blog/)

2. **Invasive Species Research:**
   Collaboration efforts are tackling the invasive European frog-bit plant and its ecological impact on the St. Marys River. Techniques include biological controls, genetic study, and fish population recovery. [Read about their research](https://www.efbcollaborative.net/current-research/)

3. **Oil Spill Response Program:**
   In partnership with Algoma University and the U.S. Coast Guard, researchers are exploring new remediation technologies to respond to environmental disasters.

## BMCC: Connecting Programs to Blue Tech
Bay Mills Community College (BMCC), a tribal college in Brimley, Michigan, plays an important role in contributing to blue tech through programs that intersect with the field:

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** BMCC’s GIS expertise provides valuable tools for mapping and monitoring Great Lakes ecozones, water systems, and habitats—key areas within the blue tech industry.

- **Community Partnerships:** BMCC’s collaborations—such as the Waganakising Odawa Career and Technical Education Program (WOCTEP)—equip students with skills focusing on sustainability, ecological monitoring, and technology integration, which align with blue tech aspirations.

## Building Aspirations
The blue tech sector offers incredible potential to transform Michigan into a global leader in sustainable innovation. However, success depends on fostering collaboration between academic institutions, industry partners, and local governments. By investing in education, aligning skills-training initiatives with practical industry needs, and advocating for strategic policies, Michigan can turn its natural waterways into a catalyst for economic resilience.

### Call to Action
Whether you’re a student, educator, or entrepreneur, blue tech presents an opportunity to shape a greener, brighter future. Support local institutions like LSSU and BMCC, explore partnerships with Great Lakes conservation groups, or dive into volunteering for blue tech research projects.
