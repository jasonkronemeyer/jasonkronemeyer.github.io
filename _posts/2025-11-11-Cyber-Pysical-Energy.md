## 🔌 DC Fault Managed Power Systems (FMPS) in the CPS Framework

DC Fault Managed Power Systems (FMPS) are engineered to safely deliver direct current in environments like buildings, vehicles, and microgrids. Here's how they align with the NIST Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework:

### CPS Aspects

- **Trustworthiness**: FMPS enhances safety and resilience by rapidly detecting and isolating faults.
- **Timing**: Real-time fault detection and coordination align with CPS timing and synchronization requirements.
- **Functionality**: FMPS supports modular, scalable power distribution for dynamic environments.

### CPS Facets

- **Abstraction**: FMPS components can be modeled for simulation and control.
- **Composition**: Supports plug-and-play integration of devices and subsystems.
- **Realization**: Includes DC cabling, converters, and fault-managed devices, emphasizing standardized, interoperable components.

## 💡 ROI Potential of DC Power in Smart Buildings & Microgrids

DC power distribution offers compelling return on investment (ROI) opportunities:

### 🔋 Energy Efficiency
- Reduces conversion losses by eliminating multiple AC-DC steps.
- Optimizes solar + storage systems with native DC operation.

### 🏢 Infrastructure Savings
- Smaller conductors and simplified wiring reduce installation costs.
- FMPS allows safe use of touch-safe voltages, minimizing conduit needs.

### ⚡ Resilience and Reliability
- Ideal for microgrid and islanded operation.
- Fault management improves uptime and lowers maintenance.

### 🌍 Sustainability
- Supports net-zero goals and seamless integration of renewables and EVs.
- Enables building-to-grid (B2G) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications.

### 📈 Operational ROI
- Lower operational expenses (OPEX) and energy bills.
- Higher asset utilization through smart power allocation.
