## Objective (Sample)
**Reduce AC-to-DC conversions across campus to improve energy efficiency, lower costs, and enable smart infrastructure.**

---

## Why This Matters
Every AC-to-DC conversion introduces energy losses (5–20%) and heat, increasing HVAC loads and operational costs. By minimizing conversions and moving toward **direct DC distribution**, schools can:

In parallel, schools can reduce the *network* side of energy waste by simplifying how connectivity is distributed. Architectures like **Passive Optical LAN (POL)** reduce the number of intermediate, always-on switches and telecom closets needed across campus—cutting electrical draw and lowering cooling demand in the spaces where network gear typically accumulates.
- Save energy and reduce carbon footprint.
- Simplify infrastructure for IoT and smart devices.
- Improve resilience and safety with modern DC systems.

---

## Key Results
1. **Energy Efficiency**
   - Achieve **8–13% reduction in ICT-related electricity use** by eliminating redundant AC/DC conversions.
   - Reduce HVAC load in network closets by **10–15%** through lower heat output.

2. **Operational Savings**
   - Consolidate UPS systems to centralized DC architecture, cutting **UPS maintenance costs by 70–78%**.
   - Free up **at least 2 network closets** for repurposing by removing excess conversion equipment.

3. **Sustainability**
   - Lower lighting energy consumption by **15–30%** using PoE/DC-powered LED systems.
   - Reduce campus carbon emissions by **20 metric tons annually** through improved efficiency.

4. **Resilience**
   - Enable **2–4 days of critical load support** during outages with integrated DC storage and solar PV.
   - Implement **Fault Managed Power Systems (FMPS)** for safe high-voltage DC distribution.

---

## Initiatives
- Deploy **DC microgrid pilot** in one building.
- Transition **PoE lighting and IoT sensors** to DC power.
- Integrate **solar PV and battery storage** without inverter losses.
- Train facilities team on **DC safety standards (UL 9540A, NFPA 855)**.
