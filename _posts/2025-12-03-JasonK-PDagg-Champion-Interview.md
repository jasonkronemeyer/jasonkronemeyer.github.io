# Community Champion Profile: Jason Kronemeyer
*Based on an interview with Dr. Pierrette Renée Dagg for the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society*

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Connectivity for Learning"
### The Origin Story (1999)
Jason’s journey began in 1999 as a computer technician "rebalancing the WAN" for the Eastern Upper Peninsula (EUP). Even then, he saw the transformative potential of the internet not just for communication, but for **self-directed learning**.
*   **Vision:** "I could see the promise of what being connected to the internet really meant... a self-directed learner could learn anything they wanted."
*   **The Mission:** This "connectivity for learning" mindset became the foundation of his career, driven by the belief that education was the first sector to recognize the internet's value beyond entertainment.

### Shifting the Conversation: Wants vs. Needs
A critical pivot in Jason's strategy was moving the community conversation from "internet as a luxury" to "internet as a necessity."
*   **The Strategy:** "We have to CREATE DEMAND OTHERWISE NOBODY IS GOING TO BUILD IT. SHIFT THE CONVERSATION from wants vs needs... We need it to not matter that they are the only student that lives on that mile."
*   **Personal Responsibility:** Jason draws a sharp distinction between his job description and his moral obligation.
    *   *Quote:* "**Connectivity at the schools - that’s a job responsibility. Connectivity in our students’ homes is my personal responsibility.**"

## 2. Historical Evolution of Connectivity in EUP
### 1997-1999: The Foundation
*   **Distance Learning:** The region connected high schools with fiber and cable modems to share classes across distances.
*   **Partnerships:** Early collaboration with Merit, LSSU, Bay Mills CC, and telecommunications companies.
*   **E-Rate (1999):** The launch of the federal E-Rate program allowed the region to subsidize these existing connections. The EUPISD created a "cooperative technology fund" governed by school districts, becoming the fiscal engine for future connectivity.

### 2003-2005: The Wireless Era & MichNet
*   **First Wireless:** EUPSchools were among the first to implement wireless access inside buildings.
*   **Creating Home Demand:** Jason worked with Merit to allow any student or teacher with an `EUP.K12.MI.US` login to dial into the internet for free via **MichNet**.
    *   *Impact:* This created the first wave of demand for home access as teachers began moving lessons online.

### 2008-2012: ARRA & BTOP
*   **The Stimulus:** Following the 2008 economic downturn, the ARRA funding provided new opportunities.
*   **BTOP Grant ($3.8M):** Provided computers to every 7th-12th grader.
*   **The Hard Lesson:** "We learned that we could drive the demand but can only be equitable if the devices don’t go home - some students lose access to the internet as soon as they step outside the school." This realization fueled the push for infrastructure.

### 2016-2018: Data & Planning
*   **The "Mapping Trap":** Early efforts focused on "working with providers," which failed because providers only focused on population centers.
*   **The Pivot to Data:**
    *   **2016:** First "Demand Survey" sent via postcards to every property owner.
    *   **2018:** **Moonshot Pilot** launched with schools.
    *   *Insight:* "It’s the data that finally showed the world the need. Then the pandemic made everyone pay attention to the data."

## 3. Strategic Frameworks for Success

### A. "Connect the Dots" (Infrastructure Planning)
*   **The Problem:** Private ISPs cannot justify the capital investment for "last mile" buildouts in rural areas.
*   **The Solution:** Map over 200 key community anchors (schools, libraries, universities, substations, healthcare, townships).
*   **The Strategy:** Build a plan to interconnect these public assets. By using public dollars to build this "middle mile" backbone, the capital investment required for private ISPs to serve homes is significantly reduced.
*   **Results:** This planning directly influenced the Merit Lift Up grant, 3 USDA Reconnect grants, and RDOF participation (including Cloverland Electric).

### B. "Many Checkbooks Make Light Work" (Resource Pooling)
*   **Concept:** No single entity—school, township, or hospital—can solve the funding gap alone.
*   **Execution:** Align application cycles (like E-Rate) with other funding programs to maximize capital investment.
*   **Quote:** "If schools and libraries act alone... what if we all worked together independently toward a common goal?"

### C. The "Multiplier" Leadership Style
*   **Background:** Jason grew up on a dairy farm, learning that "you build relationships by helping others, and if you help others, they will in turn help you."
*   **Role:** "I’m a relationship builder. It takes a village."
*   **Key Qualities:**
    *   **Teacher:** "My leadership team has continually identified that my strongest quality is that I’m a teacher. I put things in terms and in a way that people can understand."
    *   **Consummate Learner:** Constantly seeking new data (Merit events, Data Science MADS).
    *   **Trust:** Leveraging local roots and family reputation to build trust with skeptical stakeholders.

## 4. Key Insights & Reflections
*   **On Policy:** "We don't have to wait for the data to improve the policy... We have to fix the infrastructure first."
*   **On Economics:** Always demonstrate the economic benefits. Example: Helping Cloverland Electric understand the business case for infrastructure partnerships to accellerate expansion and opportunity.
*   **On Legacy:** "Have I been a multiplier or a diminisher? Our students are leaving school more successful because I am here."

## 5. Interview Context
*   **Interviewer:** Pierrette Renée Dagg
*   **Purpose:** To identify qualities of "Community Champions" in digital inclusion.
*   **Key Themes Identified:**
    *   **Building on Prior Efforts:** Jason credits mentors and the history of the EUP region (1997 distance learning) as the foundation for his work.
    *   **Data-Driven Advocacy:** Using surveys and mapping (Moonshot) to make the invisible need visible.
    *   **Relationship Building:** The "Multiplier" effect of connecting disparate organizations (Merit, ISPs, Schools, Government).
