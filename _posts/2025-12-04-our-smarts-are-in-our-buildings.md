Integrating Smart Building Technologies and Data Science into Clean Energy Workforce Development

## Context
Federal investments through the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act are catalyzing a surge in clean energy jobs. These roles increasingly intersect with smart building technologies — systems that optimize energy use, indoor air quality, and operational efficiency through automation and data analytics.

## Opportunity
Smart buildings represent a high-growth sector within clean energy infrastructure. They require a workforce skilled in:
- Building automation systems
- IoT sensor integration
- Energy management platforms
- Data science for predictive maintenance and performance optimization

## Policy Recommendations
1. Expand Regional Workforce Partnerships
    - Include smart building employers and technology vendors in clean energy workforce coalitions.
    - Support cross-sector training programs that blend HVAC, electrical, and IT skills with data analytics.
2. Modernize Curriculum and Credentials
    - Fund modular training programs that integrate smart building systems and data science into existing trades.
    - Promote stackable credentials in building automation, cybersecurity, and energy analytics.
3. Leverage Community-Based Organizations
    - Partner with trusted local groups to recruit underrepresented populations into smart building careers.
    - Provide wraparound services (e.g. digital literacy, transportation) to support retention.
4. Use Data to Drive Equity and Innovation
    - Require disaggregated data on training outcomes in smart building pathways.
    - Incentivize programs that demonstrate inclusive hiring and advancement in tech-enabled roles.
5. Align Economic and Workforce Development
    - Encourage Community Benefits Agreements that include smart building job creation.
    - Support local governments in adopting smart building standards that create demand for skilled labor.

## Conclusion
Smart buildings are a cornerstone of the clean energy transition. By embedding data science and automation into workforce strategies, states can ensure equitable access to high-wage, future-ready jobs while advancing sustainability goals.
