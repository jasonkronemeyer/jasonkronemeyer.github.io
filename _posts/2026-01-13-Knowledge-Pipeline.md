## **From Digital Literacy to AI Fluency: Building Smarter Apps with Knowledge Graphs**

Digital literacy today goes far beyond knowing how to use a browser or a spreadsheet. In an era of AI-driven decision-making, **understanding how AI systems work—and how to build them—is a critical skill**. That’s where projects like **Strwythura** come in: a hands-on workflow for creating a **Streamlit-based chatbot powered by knowledge graphs and embeddings**, all running locally.

### **Why This Matters for Digital Skills**
Most AI tools are packaged as “black boxes.” Users interact with them but rarely understand what happens behind the scenes. This creates a gap in **AI literacy**, leaving communities dependent on opaque systems. Strwythura flips the script by teaching:
- How **structured and unstructured data** feed into AI.
- Why **semantic layers and knowledge graphs** matter for trustworthy AI.
- How to integrate **open-source tools** for transparency and adaptability.

These are foundational skills for **data-centric careers**, **digital transformation initiatives**, and **community tech programs**.

### **Learning Outcomes**
By following the Strwythura workflow, learners gain:
- **Data Integration Skills**: Merge datasets using entity resolution.
- **Semantic Thinking**: Apply ontologies and taxonomies to organize knowledge.
- **Graph Literacy**: Understand nodes, edges, and relations in knowledge graphs.
- **AI Application Development**: Build a chatbot using retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG).
- **MLOps Awareness**: Explore observability and optimization for AI systems.

This is not just coding—it’s **critical thinking about data, context, and ethics**.

### **The Workflow as a Teaching Tool**
The eight-step process doubles as a curriculum for advanced digital literacy:
1. **Entity Resolution** – Teaches data cleaning and identity management.
2. **Semantic Layer** – Introduces ontology engineering.
3. **Crawl & Parse Content** – Explains NLP and zero-shot entity recognition.
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** – Highlights the role of human judgment in AI.
5. **Embeddings & Distillation** – Covers vectorization and graph algorithms.
6. **Visualization** – Builds skills in data storytelling.
7. **Enhanced GraphRAG** – Demonstrates AI reasoning beyond simple prompts.
8. **Observability & Optimization** – Connects to responsible AI practices.

### **Why Educators and Workforce Programs Should Care**
This approach aligns with **21st-century skills frameworks**:
- **Critical Thinking**: Understand how AI makes decisions.
- **Collaboration**: Combine human expertise with machine capabilities.
- **Technical Fluency**: Move from “AI user” to “AI builder.”

Imagine integrating this into **community college courses**, **K-12 STEM programs**, or **workforce reskilling initiatives**. Learners don’t just consume AI—they **create it responsibly**.
