# The Architect in the Machine: Why Information Science is the Missing Link in Digital Transformation

**By Jason Kronemeyer**

In my work at the intersection of information and technology—from building broadband infrastructure in the Upper Peninsula to designing knowledge graphs for educational AI—I often return to a simple mantra: *LearnIT | BuildIT | TeachIT*. We are very good at the "building" part. We can lay fiber, spin up servers, and train models. But as our "digital laboratories" grow more complex, we face a new challenge: **curation**.

We are drowning in data but starving for wisdom. This is where the modern librarian, specifically one with a background in Information Science, becomes not just a nice-to-have, but a mission-critical partner in the work of digital transformation.

### 1. From Data Lakes to Knowledge Graphs
My current focus on **Knowledge Graphs and AI** has reinforced a truth that library scientists have known for decades: *context is everything*. You can feed a Large Language Model a terabyte of text, but without ontology, taxonomy, and semantic structure, you are merely building a stochastic parrot.

An information scientist brings the rigor of **metadata management** and **classification theory** to our chaotic data pipelines. They don't just store data; they structure it. When we build systems to personalize learning for students, we need more than just raw code—we need a schema that understands the relationships between concepts. We need the "card catalog" of the 21st century, ensuring that the *right* information gets to the *right* learner at the *right* time.

### 2. The Ethics of "Learning in Public"
I treat my work as a practice of "learning in public," using a status system to move ideas from *Research* to *Review* to *Published*. But in an era of misinformation and algorithmic bias, this transparency comes with a heavy responsibility.

Librarians are the original guardians of **information integrity**. In my work with the **Digital Equity Learning Project**, the stakes are high. If the data guiding our broadband policy is biased or unverifiable, real communities get left behind. An information science professional serves as the ethical check on our technical ambition, ensuring our sources are cited, our data is traceable, and our algorithms respect user privacy. They transform "open source" from a code repository into a trustworthy archive of public knowledge.

### 3. Accessibility as a Design Principle
Technologists often confuse "availability" with "accessibility." We might build a high-speed network (availability), but if the interface is unusable or the information is unfindable, we haven't achieved **digital equity**.

Librarians are trained in **human-information interaction**. They understand that a system is only as good as a user's ability to navigate it. Whether I am designing a passive optical LAN or a data visualization for rural school districts, the library science perspective asks the difficult questions: *Who is this for? How will they find it? What barriers stand in their way?*

### The "Info" in Information Technology
For too long, IT has obsessed over the "T"—the technology. We fixate on the pipes, the fibers, and the GPUs. But the "I"—the information itself—is what actually matters to the people we serve.

In my journey as a data scientist and advocate, I have realized that I don't just need better engineers; I need better architects of meaning. I need the librarian who understands that while code runs the machine, **information science** is what makes it human.
