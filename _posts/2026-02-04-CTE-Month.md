February is **Career & Technical Education (CTE) Month**, and I’m reminded just how essential CTE is to the future of our communities, our economy, and our students’ sense of possibility.

CTE isn’t just about preparing learners for jobs.  
It’s about preparing them for *systems*—energy systems, broadband systems, transportation systems, healthcare systems, and the interconnected digital infrastructure that powers modern life. And right now, our students are stepping into a world where these systems are being rebuilt in real time.

Across the Eastern Upper Peninsula, I see students exploring fields like:

- **Information & Communication Technology**  
- **Cybersecurity and Networking**  
- **Construction Trades & Mass Timber**  
- **Power & Energy Technology**  
- **Manufacturing & Mechatronics**  
- **Health Careers**  
- **Public Safety & Emergency Management**  
- **Environmental and Freshwater Science**

What makes CTE so powerful is that learning becomes *applied*.  
Students don’t just study a topic - they wire it, weld it, code it, troubleshoot it, build it, and test it. They solve real problems for real people in real places like ours.

And when you combine CTE with a community that believes in **project‑based learning, broadband access, connected transportation, and modern infrastructure**, the results speak for themselves:  
students who are confident, capable, career-ready, and future-ready.

This month, I’m celebrating:

- the **CTE educators** who turn curiosity into capability  
- the **students** who choose hands-on challenges over the easy path  
- the **industry partners** who mentor, inspire, and open doors  
- the **communities** that invest in creating multiple pathways to success  

CTE isn’t a “backup plan.”  
It’s a launchpad - for college, certifications, apprenticeships, entrepreneurship, and careers that matter deeply to the places we call home.

Here’s to the learners building the next generation of networks, infrastructure, and community solutions.  
Here’s to the educators guiding them.  
Here’s to CTE Month and everything it stands for.
