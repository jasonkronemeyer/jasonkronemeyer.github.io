# Understanding Post Status Labels

As part of my commitment to **Learning in Public**, I mark each post with a status label that reflects where it is in my knowledge development process. This transparency allows you to understand the maturity of the content and how it might evolve over time.

## The Status System

### 🔍 Research
<span style="background-color: #ff9800; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">🔍 RESEARCH</span>

**What it means:** I'm actively gathering sources, exploring ideas, and doing initial investigation on this topic.

**What to expect:** Early-stage thinking, questions I'm wrestling with, and preliminary connections. These posts are the most experimental and may change significantly as my understanding deepens.

**Why I share at this stage:** Sometimes the best insights come from the research phase itself. By sharing my exploration process, I invite dialogue and discover perspectives I might have missed working alone.

### 📝 Draft
<span style="background-color: #ffc107; color: #000; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">📝 DRAFT</span>

**What it means:** I have a working version of the content, but it's still evolving. Structure and major arguments are taking shape.

**What to expect:** Core ideas are present but may lack polish. Citations might be incomplete, examples may be placeholders, and I'm still refining how everything fits together.

**Why I share at this stage:** Drafts represent substantial thinking even if unfinished. They're useful reference points for myself and others working on similar problems.

### 📋 In Review
<span style="background-color: #2196f3; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">📋 REVIEW</span>

**What it means:** Content is complete and I'm doing final review—checking citations, improving clarity, refining arguments.

**What to expect:** Near-final quality. The structure is solid, arguments are developed, and I'm making last-pass improvements. Minor edits may still occur.

**Why I share at this stage:** Review-stage posts are ready for careful reading. If you're researching similar topics, this content is stable enough to reference.

### ✨ Updated
<span style="background-color: #4caf50; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">✨ UPDATED</span>

**What it means:** This previously published post has been revised with new insights, data, or connections.

**What to expect:** Mature content that's been enriched by new learning, reader feedback, or emerging research. I typically note what changed and why.

**Why I mark updates:** Knowledge isn't static. When I learn something that changes my understanding of a published post, I update it and mark it so returning readers know there's new material.

### 📄 Brief
<span style="background-color: #9c27b0; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">📄 BRIEF</span>

**What it means:** A short-form post focused on a single topic or focused idea.

**What to expect:** Concise analysis or synthesis centered on one core point (sometimes anchored in a key source, sometimes a practical observation). These posts go deep on a narrow topic rather than attempting comprehensive coverage.

**Why I write briefs:** Not every insight requires a long-form article. Briefs let me quickly share a focused idea, highlight a useful reference, or capture a practical takeaway without turning it into a full essay.

---

### 📚 Series
<span style="background-color: #3f51b5; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">📚 SERIES</span>

**What it means:** This post is part of a connected set of articles exploring related topics or building on each other.

**What to expect:** Content that references or builds upon other posts. Look for links to previous/next posts in the series or a series overview.

**Why I write series:** Complex topics often require multiple posts to explore thoroughly. Series let me develop ideas progressively while keeping each post focused and digestible.

### 🛠️ Tutorial
<span style="background-color: #009688; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">🛠️ TUTORIAL</span>

**What it means:** Step-by-step instructional content you can follow along with hands-on.

**What to expect:** Practical, actionable guidance with code examples, commands, or procedures. Designed for learning by doing.

**Why I write tutorials:** The best way to learn is often by building. Tutorials document my own learning process and provide a roadmap for others tackling similar technical challenges.

---

### 📊 Analysis
<span style="background-color: #0277bd; color: #fff; padding: 4px 12px; border-radius: 3px; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: 500;">📊 ANALYSIS</span>

**What it means:** Deep research and data exploration with detailed methodology and findings.

**What to expect:** Data-driven investigation, statistical analysis, visualizations, and evidence-based conclusions. These posts dig into the numbers.

**Why I write analysis posts:** Data tells stories that narrative alone cannot. Analysis posts combine my data science skills with real-world questions, making research transparent and reproducible.

## The Philosophy Behind This System

This status system reflects my belief that **knowledge development is iterative and collaborative**. By showing where each piece of content sits in my thinking process, I'm inviting you into the laboratory rather than just presenting finished products.

### Why This Matters

1. **Transparency**: You can assess how much weight to give any particular post based on its maturity
2. **Process Over Product**: Learning happens in the journey, not just the destination
3. **Collaboration**: Early-stage posts invite dialogue that improves the final work
4. **Honesty**: I don't pretend to have all the answers—I'm figuring things out alongside you

### Posts Without Status Labels

Posts without any status label are considered **published and stable**. They represent my current best understanding on a topic, though I remain open to revising them if new evidence or insights emerge.
