The Cooperative Playbook: Leading with Precision, Purpose, and People

🏈 Framing Leadership Through Walsh’s Lens
When legendary coach Bill Walsh took over the San Francisco 49ers, he didn’t chase wins—he built a Standard of Performance. This wasn’t about scoreboards; it was about culture, preparation, and respect. In my post-retirement journey leading the EUPConnect Collaborative, I’ve found Walsh’s philosophy to be a powerful guide for cooperative leadership.

“Champions behave like champions before they are champions.” — Bill Walsh, The Score Takes Care of Itself

🧭 Setting the Standard of Performance
In Walsh’s system, excellence begins with clarity. For me, that meant rallying over 45 regional stakeholders—schools, governments, tribes, and healthcare providers—to pool ARPA funds and build broadband infrastructure in Michigan’s Eastern Upper Peninsula.
We didn’t wait for perfect conditions. We built trust, shared resources, and created a community-first standard. Our goal wasn’t just connectivity—it was cooperative resilience.

“If you support others, they’ll in turn help you when you need it.” — Personal guiding principle

🧠 Teaching the System
Walsh taught every player not just what to do, but why. In our work, that meant educating communities about fiber optics, funding mechanisms, and digital equity. We used data storytelling—through studies with the Quello Center and Merit Network—to make the invisible visible.
We showed that broadband gaps weren’t just technical—they were social, economic, and generational.

“The culture precedes positive results. It doesn’t get tacked on as an afterthought.” — Bill Walsh

🤝 Respecting the Process
Cooperative leadership is slow, iterative, and often invisible. Walsh called this the “process of becoming champions.” For us, it meant:
Hosting listening sessions.
Navigating political landscapes with humility.
Building coalitions that outlast any single grant cycle.
We didn’t chase headlines. We chased impact.⸻
🔁 Multiplying the Mission
In the Benton Institute’s BrdbandChampions report, I’m described as a Multiplier—someone who expands capacity and belief. Like Walsh, I believe leadership is about unlocking latent potential.
Whether it’s a retired librarian building a municipal network or a tribal elder advocating for fiber, cooperative leadership is about empowering others to lead.

“The most powerful leadership tool you have is your own personal example.” — Bill Walsh

🏁 The Score Takes Care of Itself
Walsh’s mantra reminds us that if we lead with integrity, prepare with rigor, and serve with humility, results will follow. In the Eastern Upper Peninsula, we’re not just building networks—we’re building a culture of cooperative excellence.
And that, I believe, is the real win.⸻
