## Framing Leadership Through Walsh’s Lens 🏈

When legendary coach Bill Walsh took over the San Francisco 49ers, he didn’t chase wins - he built a Standard of Performance. This wasn’t about scoreboards; it was about culture, preparation, and respect. In my work with the EUPConnect Collaborative, I’ve found Walsh’s philosophy to be a powerful guide for community-centered leadership.

## Setting the Standard of Performance 🧭

In Walsh’s system, excellence begins with clarity. For me, that meant bringing together more than 45 regional stakeholders - schools, governments, tribes, and healthcare providers - to align regional strategy with funding and facilitate broadband infrastructure across Michigan’s Eastern Upper Peninsula.

We didn’t wait for perfect conditions. We built trust, shared resources, and created a community‑first standard. Our goal wasn’t just connectivity - it was cooperative resilience.

## Teaching the System 🧠

Walsh taught every player not just what to do, but why. In our work, that meant educating communities about broadband infrastructure, funding mechanisms, and digital equity. We used storytelling with data through studies with the MSU Quello Center and Merit Network - to make the *invisible*, **visible**.

We showed that broadband gaps weren’t just technical - they were social, economic, and generational.

## Respecting the Process 🤝

Cooperative leadership is slow, iterative, and often invisible. Walsh called this the “process of becoming champions.” In practice, that meant:

- Hosting listening sessions
- Navigating political landscapes with humility
- Building coalitions that outlast any single grant cycle

We didn’t chase headlines. We chased impact.

## Multiplying the Mission 🔁

In the Benton Institute’s Broadband Champions report, Dr. Pierrette Renée Dagg describes me as a “Multiplier” - someone who expands capacity and belief. Like Walsh, I believe leadership is about unlocking latent potential.

In broadband policy, cooperative leadership means setting a clear standard, aligning community partners around shared goals, and developing local leaders who can sustain execution long after the first win.

> “The most powerful leadership tool you have is your own personal example.”
> — Bill Walsh

## The Score Takes Care of Itself 🏁

Walsh’s mantra reminds us that when we lead with integrity, prepare with rigor, and serve with humility, results follow. In the Eastern Upper Peninsula, we’re not just building networks—we’re building a culture of durable, cooperative excellence.

And that, I believe, is the real win.
