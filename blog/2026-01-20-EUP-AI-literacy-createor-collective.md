# Modeling an EUP AI Literacy & Creator Collective

Across the world, educators are stepping into new roles as co‑creators of AI tools and learning experiences—not just passive users. Here in the Eastern Upper Peninsula, we have a unique opportunity to model our own version of this movement, grounded in rural strengths, cross-sector collaboration, and a community-first vision for digital transformation.

This post outlines how Sault Area Public Schools, the EUPISD, and our regional partners could build a local **EUP AI Literacy & Creator Collective** modeled on global best practices but tailored to our region’s realities.

## Why an EUP AI Literacy Collective?

The EUP already leads nationally in broadband planning, regional shared services, and community-based innovation. With AI rapidly shaping the future of work, teaching, research, and public service, we need an approach that meets rural educators and learners where they are—while raising the ceiling for what our region can create.

A local AI Literacy & Creator Collective allows us to:

- Build shared capacity across small districts  
- Support educators through hands-on learning  
- Promote responsible and transparent AI use  
- Encourage student innovation and CTE alignment  
- Connect schools, colleges, healthcare, tribal partners, and government  
- Ensure rural Michigan has a seat at the table in shaping AI’s future

## Tier 1: EUP AI Fluency Learning Series

We begin with a structured set of learning sessions modeled after successful global programs. Here in the EUP, these sessions could be delivered through a partnership between:

- Sault Area Public Schools  
- EUPISD technology and instructional staff  
- Bay Mills Community College  
- Lake Superior State University  
- Tribal and community education partners  

These sessions—virtual or hybrid—would build baseline AI literacy for teachers, administrators, support staff, and CTE instructors. Topics could include:

- Foundations of generative AI  
- Prompt design for teaching  
- Classroom workflows  
- AI for curriculum design and assessment  
- Responsible use and policy  
- Student-centered AI creativity  

This shared foundation ensures every educator has a starting point, regardless of experience.

## Tier 2: The EUP AI Connect Community Hub

The second tier creates an always-on digital space—our own regional equivalent of an educator AI community.

This hub could be built using Slack, Teams, Moodle, or Canvas, and include spaces for:

- Prompt libraries  
- Lesson artifacts  
- Classroom case studies  
- Professional development tutorials  
- CTE and STEM student creations  
- Cross-sector sharing with healthcare, local gov, and community partners  

By building an EUP-wide network, we reduce duplication, accelerate learning, and support teachers who often work in small or isolated rural districts.

## Tier 3: The EUP AI Innovation Fellowship (Claude Lab–Style)

A selective Innovation Fellowship becomes the engine of creativity and experimentation.

Each year, a cohort of educators and CTE students from across the EUP would be chosen to:

- Build micro-apps and digital tools  
- Develop interactive lessons and artifacts  
- Test advanced AI features  
- Pilot classroom use cases  
- Work with local mentors and higher ed faculty  
- Shape district-level AI guidelines and best practices  

This fellowship becomes a proving ground for ideas—and a lighthouse for the rest of the region.

## A 60-Day Launch Roadmap

Here’s how we could stand up Version 1 of the Collective before spring:

### **Weeks 1–2**  
- Form a steering team (SAPS + EUPISD + BMCC + LSSU).  
- Define structure, platforms, and goals.  

### **Weeks 3–4**  
- Launch the first AI Fluency Session.  
- Open the community hub regionwide.  
- Begin collecting lesson artifacts.

### **Weeks 5–6**  
- Announce the Innovation Fellowship call for applications.  
- Provide a simple early artifact requirement.

### **Weeks 7–8**  
- Kick off Cohort #1.  
- Publish “EUP AI Classroom Use Cases – Version 1.”  
- Host a cross-sector roundtable aligning with the AI Connect Expo.

## Why This Matters

The EUP is at its best when we build together—schools, tribes, libraries, colleges, healthcare systems, and local governments moving in the same direction. By developing a regional AI Literacy & Creator Collective, we send a clear message:

> **> **Rural places are not waiting for the future—we’re shaping it.**
