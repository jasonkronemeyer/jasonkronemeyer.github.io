    <h1><strong>The First 5 Things to Teach a Computer</strong></h1>
    <p>Computer science is a fascinating field that blends <strong>logic, creativity</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving</strong>. It's a realm where <strong>students</strong> often find themselves in the role of a <strong>teacher</strong>, imparting knowledge to their digital pupils—computers. The journey begins with simple commands and gradually builds up to more complex tasks. Here’s a glimpse into the foundational five concepts that not only teach the computer but also shape your mind as a <strong>learner</strong>.</p>
    <h2><strong>These are the first five things I taught my first computer:</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Communication: 'Hello World!'</strong></h3>
            <p>The first lesson in computer programming is akin to <strong>teaching a child to say their first words</strong>. The 'Hello World' program is a rite of passage for all budding teachers of computers. It's simple yet profound, marking the beginning of a dialogue between human and machine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Music: Coding Melodies</strong></h3>
            <p>Next, we venture into the realm of music. Programming a computer to play 'Jingle Bells' in BASIC might seem whimsical, but it teaches the importance of <strong>sequences and timing</strong>. It's a playful way to explore how computers can interpret and execute instructions to <strong>create</strong> something as harmonious as a melody. Why Jingle Bells? I got my first computer for Christmas in 1983.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Art: Drawing with Code</strong></h3>
            <p>From auditory art, we move to visual. Drawing the Columbia Space Shuttle using BASIC commands is not just about creating a digital image; it's about <strong>understanding coordinates, geometry</strong>, and the <strong>translation</strong> of a concept into a <strong>visual</strong> form through code. Why the Space Shuttle? I dreamed of being an astronaut when I was a child.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Mathematics: The Language of Logic</strong></h3>
            <p>Mathematics is the universal language, and for computers, it's no different. Teaching a computer to calculate '2 + 2' in BASIC is an exercise in precision and <strong>logic</strong>. It's a fundamental skill that underpins more <strong>complex operations</strong> and <strong>algorithms</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Gaming: Roulette in BASIC</strong></h3>
            <p>Finally, we come to games. Programming a game of Roulette is an engaging way to bring together all the previous lessons. It encompasses <strong>communication, sequence, logic</strong>, and even a bit of <strong>randomness—elements</strong> that are crucial in many aspects of computing.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>These five lessons are more than just exercises; they are the <strong>building blocks of computational thinking</strong>. They encourage students to <strong>deconstruct problems, think algorithmically</strong>, and <strong>approach challenges with a computational perspective</strong>. In our increasingly <strong>digital world</strong>, these <strong>skills are invaluable</strong>, transcending beyond the screen and <strong>influencing various aspects of life</strong>.</p>
    <p>As we continue to advance in technology, the lessons we teach computers—and in turn, ourselves—will evolve. But the essence remains the same: to <strong>communicate, create, calculate</strong>, and <strong>play</strong>. These are not just tasks; they are the cornerstones of innovation in our digital age. So, let's keep <strong>teaching, learning</strong>, and <strong>exploring</strong> the limitless potential of <strong>computer science</strong>.</p>
    <p>Today, thanks to the intelligence my computer has gained from being taught in these areas, I can ask it to help me write this blog post that I have been thinking about for several years.</p>
    <p>Who knows what the next <strong>'Hello World'</strong> might bring?</p>
