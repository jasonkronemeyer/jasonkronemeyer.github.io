**The First 5 Things to Teach a Computer**

Computer science is a fascinating field that blends **logic, creativity**, and **problem-solving**. It's a realm where **students** often find themselves in the role of a **teacher**, imparting knowledge to their digital pupils—computers. The journey begins with simple commands and gradually builds up to more complex tasks. Here’s a glimpse into the foundational five concepts that not only teach the computer but also shape your mind as a **learner**.

**These are the first five things I taught my first computer:**

1. **Communication: 'Hello World!'**
The first lesson in computer programming is akin to **teaching a child to say their first words**. The 'Hello World' program is a rite of passage for all budding teachers of computers. It's simple yet profound, marking the beginning of a dialogue between human and machine.

2. **Music: Coding Melodies**
Next, we venture into the realm of music. Programming a computer to play 'Jingle Bells' in BASIC might seem whimsical, but it teaches the importance of **sequences and timing**. It's a playful way to explore how computers can interpret and execute instructions to **create** something as harmonious as a melody. Why Jingle Bells? I got my first computer for Christmas in 1983.

3. **Art: Drawing with Code**
From auditory art, we move to visual. Drawing the Columbia Space Shuttle using BASIC commands is not just about creating a digital image; it's about **understanding coordinates, geometry**, and the **translation** of a concept into a **visual** form through code. Why the Space Shuttle? I dreamed of being an astronaught when I was a child.

4. **Mathematics: The Language of Logic**
Mathematics is the universal language, and for computers, it's no different. Teaching a computer to calculate '2 + 2' in BASIC is an exercise in precision and **logic**. It's a fundamental skill that underpins more **complex operations** and **algorithms**.

5. **Gaming: Roulette in BASIC**
Finally, we come to games. Programming a game of Roulette is an engaging way to bring together all the previous lessons. It encompasses **communication, sequence, logic,** and even a bit of **randomness—elements** that are crucial in many aspects of computing.

These five lessons are more than just exercises; they are the ""building blocks of computational thinking**. They encourage students to **deconstruct problems, think algorithmically**, and **approach challenges with a computational perspective**. In our increasingly **digital world,** these **skills are invaluable**, transcending beyond the screen and **influencing various aspects of life**.

As we continue to advance in technology, the lessons we teach computers—and in turn, ourselves—will evolve. But the essence remains the same: to **communicate, create, calculate,** and **play**. These are not just tasks; they are the cornerstones of innovation in our digital age. So, let's keep **teaching, learning,** and **exploring** the limitless potential of **computer science**. 

Today, thanks to the intelligence my computer has gained from being taught in these areas, I can ask it to help me write this blog post that I have been thinking about for several years. 

Who knows what the next **'Hello World'** might bring?
