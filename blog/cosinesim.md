Cosine similarity is a measure used to determine how similar two vectors are, regardless of their magnitude. It's widely used in various fields, such as text analysis, data mining, and machine learning. Here's a brief overview:
Cosine Similarity Formula
The cosine similarity between two vectors (A) and (B) is calculated as:
$$ \text{cosine similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{|A| |B|} $$
Where:
(A \cdot B) is the dot product of the vectors.
(|A|) and (|B|) are the magnitudes (or lengths) of the vectors.
Applications of Cosine Similarity
Text Analysis: Used to measure the similarity between documents by representing them as vectors of word frequencies.
Recommendation Systems: Helps in finding similar items or users based on their preferences.
Clustering: Assists in grouping similar data points together in clustering algorithms.
