## 1. Executive Summary

Broadband investments have significantly expanded network reach and capacity, yet many communities, particularly rural and underserved regions, lack the local digital infrastructure required to fully realize the economic, educational, and civic value of those networks. While fiber, wireless, and satellite connectivity provide essential access, communities remain dependent on distant cloud resources for data processing, storage, and advanced applications. This dependency results in higher costs, increased latency, reduced resilience, and limited opportunities to build local capacity.

This project proposes the deployment of a locally operated, distributed digital infrastructure platform that extends the value of broadband by placing cloud like capabilities, including compute, storage, and application services, directly within the community. The platform will support schools, local governments, utilities, and other anchor institutions by enabling secure local data processing, improved resilience, and shared access to advanced digital services. By integrating directly with existing and planned broadband infrastructure, the project transforms connectivity investments into a durable community asset that supports long term economic development, workforce readiness, and digital equity.

## 2. Problem Statement and Need

Public investment in broadband has primarily focused on network deployment and access, with comparatively limited attention to how communities will use, manage, and sustain the digital services that rely on those networks. As a result, several challenges persist.

Anchor institutions generate increasing volumes of data but must transmit that data to distant cloud facilities for processing and storage. Latency sensitive applications such as education technology, public safety systems, and smart infrastructure either underperform or remain infeasible. Communities face ongoing operating expenses and vendor dependency without building local technical capacity or control. Broadband investments risk becoming single purpose infrastructure rather than a foundation for innovation and resilience.

Planning and policy research increasingly recognize that edge and distributed computing represent the next phase of critical digital infrastructure. Without complementary local infrastructure, communities cannot fully capture the public value of broadband investments.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed project will deploy a community based distributed digital infrastructure platform located within the project region and operated in coordination with local partners. The platform will provide local compute and storage resources capable of supporting multiple institutions. It will integrate with existing broadband networks to reduce backhaul requirements and improve application performance. The platform will support selective synchronization with regional or national cloud services while maintaining local control. Governance models will prioritize data stewardship, shared benefit, and long term community ownership.

This approach mirrors traditional public infrastructure models such as electrical substations or water treatment facilities by providing a shared, foundational service upon which multiple programs and applications can operate.

## 4. Key Capabilities and Functions

### Local Data Processing and Storage

The platform will enable institutions to process and store sensitive or high volume data locally. This improves performance while supporting privacy, compliance, and data stewardship requirements.

### Resilience and Continuity

By operating independently of upstream cloud connectivity, the platform enhances continuity of operations during outages and emergencies. Critical services can continue to function when external connectivity is disrupted.

### Shared Community Infrastructure

Designed as a multi tenant resource, the platform reduces duplication of systems and enables cost sharing among schools, municipalities, libraries, and utilities. This shared model improves efficiency and long term affordability.

### Innovation Enablement

The platform provides a foundation for emerging applications, including artificial intelligence inference, smart building systems, digital twins, and applied workforce training. These capabilities can be supported without requiring future infrastructure replacement.

## 5. Alignment with Broadband and Infrastructure Funding Priorities

This project aligns with federal, state, and philanthropic broadband and infrastructure priorities by extending the value of broadband investments beyond basic access. It supports digital equity through shared, community governed infrastructure. It enhances economic resilience by reducing dependence on distant digital resources. It enables workforce development through hands on, place based technical capacity building. It promotes sustainability by reducing unnecessary data transport and recurring operating costs.

By integrating digital infrastructure into broader planning and capital strategies, the project reflects best practices in long term broadband stewardship.

---

## 6. Anticipated Outcomes

The project is expected to improve performance and reliability for education, public safety, and civic applications. It will reduce operating costs while increasing local control over digital services. The platform will expand community capacity for innovation and workforce training. It will strengthen the return on investment for existing and future broadband funding. The project will also produce a replicable model for other communities seeking to move beyond connectivity alone.

---

## 7. Sustainability and Long Term Impact

The platform is designed as foundational infrastructure rather than a pilot or single use project. Long term sustainability will be supported through shared use agreements among anchor institutions, incremental scaling aligned with community needs, and integration with ongoing broadband, capital, and workforce programs.

By serving multiple missions over time, the platform ensures that public investment continues to deliver value beyond the initial grant period.

## 8. Conclusion

Broadband connectivity is a necessary but insufficient condition for digital transformation. This project addresses the next critical step by ensuring that communities possess local digital infrastructure capacity to fully leverage connectivity investments. By building a distributed, community based platform, the project converts broadband from a recurring expense into a strategic asset that supports resilience, equity, and long term economic vitality.
