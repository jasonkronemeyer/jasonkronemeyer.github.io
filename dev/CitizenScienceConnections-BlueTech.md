## 5. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) Documentation

### **Background**
**Found in:** Current Blue Tech article mentions "Anishinaabe place names along St. Marys River" as potential student project

### **Expansion: TEK as Citizen Science**

**What is TEK?**
- Traditional Ecological Knowledge held by Indigenous communities
- Multigenerational observations of ecosystems
- Cultural and spiritual relationships with water
- Historical patterns not captured in short-term scientific data

**Examples of TEK Relevant to Blue Tech:**
- Traditional fishing locations and seasonal patterns
- Historical water levels and quality observations
- Indigenous names for waterways (encode ecological knowledge)
- Customary management practices (sustainable harvest)
- Climate change observations spanning generations

### **Student Projects: Bridging TEK and Modern Science**

**1. Digital Archive of Water Knowledge**
- BMCC students interview tribal elders (with community permission)
- Record stories about historical fish populations, water quality, seasonal changes
- Transcribe and tag with geographic coordinates
- Create searchable database connecting oral history to modern monitoring data

**2. Place Names Mapping Project**
- Document Anishinaabe names for waterways, bays, fishing spots
- Many place names describe ecological features (rapids, deep water, fish abundance)
- Build interactive map overlaying traditional names with modern sensor locations
- Shows Indigenous knowledge identified important monitoring sites centuries ago

**3. Comparative Analysis**
- Compare tribal elder observations with MiWaterNet sensor data
- Do traditional knowledge and scientific data align?
- Where do they diverge, and what does that teach us?
- Co-author research papers with tribal knowledge holders as equal contributors

### **Ethical Considerations**
**From your pk12-datascience-ethics-checklist.md:**
> "Assembling a diverse team to oversee and implement the project will help ensure that multiple perspectives are gathered which will ensure that we are protecting from harm and maximizing benefit"

**Principles for TEK Citizen Science:**
- Tribal sovereignty: Community controls data use and sharing
- Informed consent: Clear explanations in accessible language
- Co-ownership: Research findings belong to community
- Cultural sensitivity: Honor sacred knowledge that shouldn't be shared publicly
- Benefit to community: Research must serve tribal priorities

### **Why This Matters**
- **For Students:** Learn research ethics, cultural humility, interdisciplinary thinking
- **For Tribal Communities:** Technology preserves endangered knowledge, supports self-determination
- **For Science:** Enriches understanding with long-term observational data
- **For Blue Tech:** Demonstrates technology can honor Indigenous values

**From TrainingCompassNavigators.md:**
> "You're building capabilities (Sen's conversion factors)... this is theory-grounded practice"

TEK documentation builds capabilities for students AND tribal knowledge keepers to participate in research as equals.

## 6. Data Privacy Ethics Framework

### **Background**
**Found in:** papers/pk12-datascience-ethics-checklist.md

You developed **"A Checklist for Student Data Privacy in School District Data Science Projects"**

### **Original Purpose**
- Protect students' personally identifiable information in K-12 data science projects
- Based on U.S. Department of Education Privacy Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) resources
- Incorporates deon ethics checklist for data scientists
- Covers entire data science lifecycle: Design → Collection → Analysis → Publication

### **Key Principles**
1. **Transparency:** Clear privacy policies in accessible language
2. **Limitation of Use:** Data used only for stated purposes
3. **Access and Correction:** Individuals can review and correct their data
4. **Data Quality:** Accurate, complete, current information
5. **Security:** Protection from unintended disclosure

### **Connection to Citizen Science**
**Most citizen science projects DON'T have this level of ethical guidance.**

**Why It's Critical for Blue Tech Citizen Science:**

**1. Student Participants are Minors**
- FERPA protections apply
- Parental consent required
- Extra care with public data sharing

**2. Tribal Data Sovereignty**
- Tribal communities have sovereignty over data collected on tribal lands
- Traditional knowledge has cultural ownership
- Community consent differs from individual consent
- Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles apply

**3. Sensitive Environmental Data**
- Revealing water quality issues could impact property values
- Fishing location data could lead to overharvesting
- Climate change observations might be politically contentious

### **Application to BMCC Blue Tech Projects**

**Before Any Citizen Science Project:**
- [ ] Assemble diverse oversight team (students, faculty, tribal leaders, community members)
- [ ] Define clear benefits to students and community
- [ ] Develop privacy policy in plain language
- [ ] Create data sharing agreements respecting tribal sovereignty
- [ ] Train all participants on privacy policies
- [ ] Implement security measures for data protection
- [ ] Plan to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information
- [ ] Schedule data deletion after project completion
- [ ] Establish monitoring plan for ongoing privacy compliance

**Specific to TEK Documentation:**
- [ ] Obtain tribal council approval before any interviews
- [ ] Clear protocols for what knowledge can/cannot be shared publicly
- [ ] Community owns all recordings, transcripts, and derived data
- [ ] Right to withdraw knowledge from research at any time
- [ ] Co-authorship and benefit-sharing agreements upfront

### **Differentiator**
**Your framework gives BMCC a competitive advantage:**
- Most universities doing citizen science lack comprehensive ethics protocols
- Tribal communities often (rightfully) skeptical of academic research
- Demonstrating ethical framework upfront builds trust
- Positions BMCC as leader in ethical community-engaged research

**From your checklist:**
> "Prior to the collection of any student PII for the project, we need to ensure that the primary benefits to the student are identified"

This applies equally to citizen science: **Community benefit must be clear BEFORE data collection begins.**

- Time-series data at each location
- Spatial relationships (upstream/downstream, tributaries, watersheds)
- Perfect dataset for teaching spatial analysis

### **Student Learning Opportunities**

**1. GIS Fundamentals**
- Map sensor locations and tribal waters
- Overlay with land use, population, infrastructure
- Identify undermonitored areas needing additional sensors

**2. Spatial Statistics**
- Autocorrelation: Are nearby sensors more similar?
- Hotspot analysis: Where are water quality issues concentrated?
- Interpolation: Estimate water quality between sensor locations

**3. Spatial Equity Analysis**
- Do tribal lands have adequate monitoring coverage?
- Are low-income communities near polluted waterways?
- Does sensor placement reflect community priorities?

**4. Predictive Spatial Modeling**
- Can upstream sensors predict downstream water quality?
- What watershed characteristics explain sensor variations?
- Where should next sensors be deployed for maximum impact?

### **Citizen Science Integration**

**Community-Collected Spatial Data:**
- **GPS-tagged observations:** Community members report fish kills, algae blooms, unusual colors/smells
- **Photo documentation:** Georeferenced images of water conditions
- **Traditional fishing spots:** Elder knowledge mapped to coordinates
- **Accessibility:** Where can people actually access water for recreation/subsistence?

**Students Analyze Combined Dataset:**
- Official sensors (MiWaterNet) + Community observations (citizen science)
- Are there spatial patterns the sensors miss?
- Do community concerns align with sensor data?
- What do spatial gaps reveal about monitoring priorities?

### **Research Questions Students Could Investigate**

**Spatial-Temporal Analysis:**
- How do seasonal patterns vary spatially across the watershed?
- Do spring runoff impacts spread downstream in predictable patterns?
- Which locations show most variability (need more frequent monitoring)?

**Environmental Justice:**
- Are tribal treaty waters adequately monitored?
- Do rural communities have equal access to water quality information?
- How far must people travel to reach a monitored site?

**Climate Change Adaptation:**
- Which locations show earliest warming trends?
- Are spatial patterns of water quality change consistent with climate models?
- Where are aquatic ecosystems most vulnerable?

### **Why This Matters**
**From your research focus:**
> "Informing policy decisions with data-driven community insights"

Spatial citizen science gives communities **evidence** for advocacy:
- "Our treaty waters are undermonitored" (show the map)
- "Water quality declining in this watershed" (show the trend)
- "We need sensors here" (justify with spatial analysis)

**Your role:** Teaching students to do this analysis transforms citizen science from data collection to community empowerment.

## 8. Community Needs Assessments

### **Background**
**Found in:** research/digital-navigation-maslow.md

**Your Research Methodology:**
> "Community Interviews: Stakeholder perspectives on digital navigation needs"
> "Program Evaluation: Effectiveness analysis of existing digital navigator programs"

### **Your Approach to Community-Based Research**
- Interviews with stakeholders
- Participatory evaluation
- Community-identified priorities guide research
- Implementation testing in real-world settings

### **Connection to Blue Tech**
**Before deploying sensors, conduct water quality needs assessments:**

**Research Questions for Community:**
1. What water-related concerns matter most to you?
2. Where do you access water for subsistence, recreation, ceremony?
3. What changes have you observed in water quality over your lifetime?
4. What information would help you make decisions about water use?
5. Who do you trust to provide that information?

**Student Role:**
- Design interview protocols (research methods class)
- Conduct interviews with community members
- Transcribe and code qualitative data
- Identify themes and priorities
- Present findings to community and researchers

### **Application Example: Sensor Placement**

**Traditional Approach (Research-Driven):**
- Researchers decide where sensors go based on scientific criteria
- May miss community priorities
- Communities don't engage with data they didn't help generate

**Community Needs Assessment Approach (Community-Driven):**
1. Students interview tribal community about water concerns
2. Community identifies priority monitoring locations (fishing spots, drinking water sources, sacred sites)
3. Map community priorities + scientific criteria
4. Place sensors where community needs and scientific value overlap
5. Community invested in data because they shaped the research

### **Why This Matters**

**From TrainingCompassAppadurai.md (Capacity to Aspire):**
> "People with more resources have practiced aspiration more... wealth gives people more opportunities to learn the culture of aspiration"

**Needs assessments build capacity to aspire:**
- Community members practice articulating concerns
- Participate in research design decisions
- See their input shape actual sensor deployment
- Learn "I can influence how research happens"

**Contrast with Traditional Academic Research:**
- Researchers → Community: "We're studying your water"
- Our Approach → Community ↔ Researchers: "What should we study together?"

### **Student Learning Outcomes**
**Research Skills:**
- Qualitative interview methods
- Community-based participatory research (CBPR)
- Culturally responsive research design
- Stakeholder engagement

**Ethical Practice:**
- Research WITH communities, not ON communities
- Community consent throughout process
- Reciprocity: What does community gain?
- Humility: Academic knowledge isn't only valid knowledge

**Professional Development:**
- Working with diverse populations
- Translating between technical and non-technical language
- Navigating community politics and priorities
- Building trust across cultural differences

### **Implementation in BMCC Courses**

**CS204 (Web Design):**
- Create survey tools for community input
- Build websites presenting needs assessment findings
- Design interfaces showing how community priorities shaped research

**CS221 (Programming):**
- Process and analyze qualitative data
- Text analysis of interview transcripts
- Generate visualizations showing community priorities

**GIS Courses:**
- Map community-identified priority locations
- Participatory mapping exercises with tribal members
- Compare community priorities to existing sensor coverage

### **Long-Term Impact**
**Ensures technology serves community-identified needs, not external agendas.**

If sensors are placed based on community needs assessments → Community engages with data → Data informs tribal policy → Technology serves self-determination.

**This is the opposite of technology colonialism.**
