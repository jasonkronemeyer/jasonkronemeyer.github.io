# Developing the Ontology for The Digital Compass Navigator and the Populations they Serve

The following is towards developing an ontology for Digital Compass Navigators and the Target Populations they serve. This is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the various properties involved and thought brainstorming.

## Ontology Code

```python
from owlready2 import *

# Create a new ontology
onto = get_ontology("http://example.org/digital_navigator.owl")

with onto:
    # Define classes
    class DigitalCompassNavigator(Thing): pass
    class Service(Thing): pass
    class Population(Thing): pass
    class Skill(Thing): pass
    class Program(Thing): pass

    # Define properties
    class provides_service(ObjectProperty):
        domain = [DigitalCompassNavigator]
        range = [Service]

    class serves_population(ObjectProperty):
        domain = [DigitalCompassNavigator]
        range = [Population]

    class has_skill(ObjectProperty):
        domain = [DigitalCompassNavigator]
        range = [Skill]

    class part_of_program(ObjectProperty):
        domain = [DigitalCompassNavigator]
        range = [Program]

    # Define individuals for Services
    general_support = Service("GeneralDigitalInclusionSupport")
    education_support = Service("EducationSupport")
    healthcare_support = Service("HealthcareSupport")
    workforce_support = Service("WorkforceDevelopmentSupport")

    # Define individuals for Populations
    pwd_population = Population("PeopleWithDisabilities")
    justice_population = Population("JusticeImpactedIndividuals")
    migrantworkers_population = Population("MigrantWorkers")
    students_population = Population("HigherEducationStudents")
    caregivers_population = Population("CaregiversToK12Students")
    seniors_population = Population("Seniors")
    elders_population = Population("TribalElders")
    low_income_population = Population("LowIncomeFamilies")
    rural_population = Population("RuralResidents")

    # Define individuals for Skills
    digital_literacy_skill = Skill("DigitalLiteracy")
    online_safety_skill = Skill("OnlineSafety")

    # Define individuals for Programs
    acc_program = Program("AmericanConnectionCorp")

# Save the ontology to a file
onto.save(file="digital_navigator.owl")

print("Combined ontology for Digital Compass Navigator and Target Populations has been created and saved to digital_navigator.owl.")
```

## Explanation of the Properties

1. **provides_service**:
   - **Domain**: DigitalCompassNavigator
   - **Range**: Service
   - **Description**: This property indicates that a Digital Compass Navigator provides a specific type of service. For example, a Digital Compass Navigator might provide general digital inclusion support, education support, healthcare support, or workforce development support.

2. **serves_population**:
   - **Domain**: DigitalCompassNavigator
   - **Range**: Population
   - **Description**: This property specifies the population that a Digital Compass Navigator serves. Populations can include people with disabilities, justice-impacted individuals, migrants and refugees, higher education students, caregivers to K-12 students, seniors, low-income families, and rural residents.

3. **has_skill**:
   - **Domain**: DigitalCompassNavigator
   - **Range**: Skill
   - **Description**: This property denotes the skills that a Digital Compass Navigator possesses. Skills can include digital literacy and online safety.

4. **part_of_program**:
   - **Domain**: DigitalCompassNavigator
   - **Range**: Program
   - **Description**: This property indicates that a Digital Compass Navigator is part of a specific program. For example, a Digital Compass Navigator might be part of the American Connection Corp, 4-H Digital Changemakers, Tribal Elder Services, Community Action, United Way or other community service agencies.

Building on these properties, the ontology provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the roles and functions of Digital Compass Navigators, the services they provide, the populations they serve, the skills they possess, and the programs they are part of. This structure allows for a detailed and organized representation of digital inclusion efforts.
