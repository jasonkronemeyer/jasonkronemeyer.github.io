## Overview
The report, presented at **TPRC 2023**, introduces a **multi-centric, agile framework** for monitoring, evaluating, and guiding broadband and digital equity policies. It addresses the challenges posed by rapid technological transformation and emphasizes iterative learning cycles for policy improvement.[1](https://jasonkronemeyercom.sharepoint.com/sites/BTAProjectCompass/Shared%20Documents/General/TPRC23-A-Comprehensive-Framework-to-Monitor-Evaluate-and-Guide-Broadband-Digital-Equity-Policy-ssrn-4557340.pdf?web=1)

## Core Concepts
- **Digital Opportunities Compass**  
  A structured tool for assessing broadband and digital equity initiatives across six dimensions:  
  *Contexts, Governance, Connectivity, Skills, Applications, Outcomes.*  
  This compass enables stakeholders to identify gaps and prioritize interventions effectively.[1](https://jasonkronemeyercom.sharepoint.com/sites/BTAProjectCompass/Shared%20Documents/General/TPRC23-A-Comprehensive-Framework-to-Monitor-Evaluate-and-Guide-Broadband-Digital-Equity-Policy-ssrn-4557340.pdf?web=1)

- **Policy Learning Approach**  
  The framework advocates for continuous feedback loops, integrating empirical evidence and stakeholder input to refine strategies. This concept aligns with the idea of a "policy learning machine," where iterative evaluation drives adaptive policymaking.[1](https://jasonkronemeyercom.sharepoint.com/sites/BTAProjectCompass/Shared%20Documents/General/TPRC23-A-Comprehensive-Framework-to-Monitor-Evaluate-and-Guide-Broadband-Digital-Equity-Policy-ssrn-4557340.pdf?web=1)

## Key Contributions
- **Agility in Policy Design**  
  Encourages flexible, data-driven decision-making to respond to evolving broadband needs.
- **Equity-Centered Metrics**  
  Provides indicators for measuring digital inclusion beyond mere access, incorporating affordability, skills, and community capacity.
- **Collaborative Governance**  
  Highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder engagement, including local governments, nonprofits, and research institutions.[1](https://jasonkronemeyercom.sharepoint.com/sites/BTAProjectCompass/Shared%20Documents/General/TPRC23-A-Comprehensive-Framework-to-Monitor-Evaluate-and-Guide-Broadband-Digital-Equity-Policy-ssrn-4557340.pdf?web=1)

## Why It Matters
This framework is critical for ensuring that broadband expansion and digital equity programs are **effective, inclusive, and sustainable**, particularly in rural and underserved communities.
