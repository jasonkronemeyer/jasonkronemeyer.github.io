# The Michigan Digital Equity Research Ecosystem

How Michigan's research institutions, your lived experience, and policy advocacy created an integrated knowledge-to-action pipeline for digital equity.

## **The Complete Michigan Connection:**

**Your digital equity framework isn't built in isolation—it's part of a vibrant Michigan research ecosystem that connects:**

- University of Michigan researchers
- Michigan State University Quello Center
- Merit Network (Michigan's R&E network)
- Your community participation (K-12 Citizen Science)
- State policy implementation (BEAD/DEA)

**This document shows how it all connects.**

---

## **The Michigan Research Institutions:**

## **Your Participation: "Research Became Our Voice"**

From your blog post (2025-10-30):
> *"Through our partnership with the Quello Center at Michigan State University and Merit Network's Michigan Moonshot Initiative, we finally had amplification of our local voice through data and policy research. We were blessed to participate in the K–12 Citizen Science project, which helped quantify the effect that poor policy design has on communities with no voice."*

**What this means:**

### **The K-12 Citizen Science Project**

**What it was:**
- Community-based data collection for Hampton et al. (2020) research
- Michigan families reported broadband access, use patterns, school outcomes
- Rural and underserved communities CONTRIBUTING to research (not just subjects)

**Your role:**
- Participated as community member
- Shared lived experience of rural digital divide
- Helped quantify infrastructure, value, and skill gaps

**Result:**
```
Your experience:
  "We have infrastructure but students aren't using it effectively"
  
Hampton & Bauer research:
  "Unclear value" gap identified as distinct barrier
  
Your framework:
  Aspiration stage (Appadurai's navigation capacity) addresses this
  
Policy impact:
  NTIA shifts from infrastructure-only to comprehensive digital equity
```

**This is participatory research at its best!**

---

### **From Anecdote to Evidence**

**Before research participation:**
```
You: "Rural communities struggle with more than just access"
Policymakers: "That's anecdotal, we need data"
```

**After research participation:**
```
Hampton & Bauer (2020): "Three distinct gaps identified in Michigan K-12 data"
  - Infrastructure gap (Opportunity)
  - Unclear value gap (Aspiration)
  - Skill gap (Growth Mindset)

You: "This research PROVES what we've experienced. Here's the DOI."
Policymakers: "This is empirical evidence. Let's adjust policy."
```

**Research became your voice in policy discussions.**

---

## **The Research Lineage:**

### **2020: Hampton & Bauer - Empirical Validation**

**Title:** "Broadband and Student Performance Gaps"  
**DOI:** 10.25335/BZGY-3V91  
**Institution:** MSU Quello Center  
**Your role:** K-12 Citizen Science project participant  

**Key findings:**
1. Missing infrastructure → Access gap
2. Unclear value → Engagement gap  
3. Insufficient skills → Achievement gap

**Maps to your framework:**
1. Opportunity stage (Sen's capabilities)
2. Aspiration stage (Appadurai's navigation)
3. Growth Mindset stage (Dweck's learning)

---

### **2023: Dagg et al. - Measurement Framework**

**Title:** "Digital Opportunities Compass"  
**Institution:** MSU Quello + Merit Network + NDIA  
**Bauer's role:** Co-author (connecting 2020 evidence → 2023 measurement)  

**Six components:**
1. Contexts - Demographics, economics
2. Governance - Policy, power structures
3. Connectivity - Infrastructure (measures Opportunity)
4. Skills - Literacy, training (measures Growth Mindset)
5. Application - Use, relevance (measures Aspiration)
6. Outcomes - Achievement, inclusion (measures Equity)

**Your role:** Operationalizing Compass for Michigan counties in knowledge graph system

---

### **Your System (2024-2025): Implementation**

**Components:**
- Knowledge graph stores Compass metrics + theory + evidence
- Bayesian networks predict intervention outcomes
- GraphRAG answers policy questions with evidence

**Grounds in:**
- Hampton & Bauer (2020) empirical findings
- Dagg et al. (2023) measurement framework
- Toyama amplification principle
- Sen, Appadurai, Dweck theories

**Result:** Complete pipeline from Michigan research → Michigan policy implementation

---

## **The Continuity: Bauer's Role**

**Johannes M. Bauer appears on BOTH key papers:**

**Hampton et al. (2020):**
- Co-author
- Empirical research identifying three gaps
- Michigan K-12 data analysis

**Dagg et al. (2023):**
- Co-author
- Measurement framework development
- Operationalizing findings for BEAD/DEA

**Why this matters:**
```
Bauer ensures continuity:
  
  2020 Research: "Here's what we found (three gaps)"
    ↓
  2023 Framework: "Here's how to measure them (Compass)"
    ↓
  Your System: "Here's how to use measurements for policy decisions"
```

**From discovery → measurement → implementation, with research continuity**

---

## **Geographic Diversity: Why Michigan Data Matters**

**Michigan provides ideal testbed for digital equity research:**

### **1. Urban-Rural Spectrum**

```
Urban (Detroit, Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor):
  - High infrastructure availability
  - Affordability challenges
  - Digital literacy gaps
  
Suburban (Oakland County, Washtenaw):
  - Good infrastructure + adoption
  - Skills variability
  - Application diversity
  
Rural (Upper Peninsula, Northern LP):
  - Infrastructure gaps
  - Aspiration capacity challenges
  - Skills + opportunity compounded
```

**Your framework tested across ALL contexts**

---

### **2. Demographic Diversity**

- **Income:** Wealthy suburbs to distressed rural areas
- **Race/Ethnicity:** Diverse urban centers, predominantly white rural
- **Age:** College towns (young) to retirement communities (older)
- **Education:** PhD-dense Ann Arbor to limited K-12 access rural

**Hampton & Bauer findings validated across demographics**

---

### **3. Infrastructure Variance**

- **Fiber-rich:** Ann Arbor, East Lansing (university influence)
- **Cable-dominant:** Suburban Detroit, Grand Rapids
- **Underserved:** UP, Northern LP (sparse population, rugged terrain)

**Compass Connectivity component captures this variance**

---

## **Policy Impact Timeline:**

### **2018-2019: Lived Experience**

```
You: Working in EUPConnect, experiencing rural digital divide
Community: "We have internet but it's not helping like we hoped"
```

---

### **2020: Research Validates Experience**

```
Hampton & Bauer research published
Finding: "Unclear value" gap distinct from infrastructure gap
You: "This is EXACTLY what we experienced!"
```

---

### **2021-2022: Federal Policy Shift**

```
IIJA passes with $65B for broadband
Includes Digital Equity Act (not just infrastructure!)
NTIA guidance emphasizes:
  - Infrastructure (Opportunity)
  - Adoption (Aspiration)
  - Digital literacy (Growth Mindset)

This IS your framework at federal level!
```

---

### **2023: Michigan Implementation**

```
Michigan develops BEAD/DEA plans
Dagg Compass framework released as guide
Bauer connects 2020 research → 2023 measurement
```

---
