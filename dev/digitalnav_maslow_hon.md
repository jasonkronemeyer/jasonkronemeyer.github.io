# Digital Navigator Definition and Model for Digital Inclusion Update (DRAFT)

In 2020, the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) established a definition for the term "digital navigator." This model for digital inclusion has evolved over the years to meet community needs and continues to adapt to new challenges.<sup>[1]</sup>

## Core Elements of the Digital Navigator Model

1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The digital navigator model is designed to be easily replicated and adaptable to various contexts and target populations.
2. **Evolution and Community Needs**: The model has evolved to address community needs and organizational capacities, such as helping with affordability programs and dedicating more time to digital skills training.<sup>[1]</sup>
3. **Holistic Support**: Digital navigators provide comprehensive, personalized support through ongoing interactions.<sup>[1]</sup>
4. **Variety of Roles**: Support services may be offered under different titles, such as digital navigators, digital coordinators, digital ambassadors, and digital coaches.
5. **Diverse Populations**: They serve a wide range of populations, including tribal elders, seniors, people with disabilities, justice-impacted individuals, migrants, refugees, students, and caregivers.<sup>[1]</sup>

## Digital Navigator Model and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

The digital navigator model aligns well with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, addressing various levels of human motivation and aspiration.<sup>[2][3][4]</sup>

### Key Relationships

- **Physiological Needs**: Digital navigators help individuals meet basic needs by supporting access to essential online services such as healthcare, food assistance, and housing resources.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
- **Safety Needs**: By ensuring secure internet access and educating users on online safety, digital navigators contribute to a sense of security and stability.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
- **Love and Belonging**: Digital navigators foster community connections by helping individuals stay in touch with family and friends, and participate in social networks.<sup>[1][2]</sup>
- **Esteem**: Through digital literacy training and support, digital navigators empower individuals, boosting their confidence and self-esteem.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>
- **Self-Actualization**: By providing access to educational resources and opportunities for personal growth, digital navigators help individuals achieve their full potential.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>

The model has been adapted by many organizations to meet the unique needs of their communities, demonstrating its versatility and importance in promoting digital inclusion.<sup>[1]</sup>
