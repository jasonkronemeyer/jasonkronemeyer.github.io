# Digital Navigator Definition and Model for Digital Inclusion Update

In 2020, the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) established a definition for the term "digital navigator." This model for digital inclusion has evolved over the years to meet community needs and organizational capacities. In 2024, the definition was updated by the NDIA to reflect new standards and practices in digital inclusion. The digital navigator model is highly replicable and flexible to work in a variety of settings and target populations. Here is a summary of the model:

1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The digital navigator model is designed to be easily replicated and adaptable to various settings and target populations.
2. **Evolution and Community Needs**: The model has evolved to address community needs and organizational capacities, such as helping with the Affordable Connectivity Program and dedicating more time to digital skills.
3. **Holistic Support**: Digital navigators provide comprehensive, personalized support through ongoing interactions.
4. **Variety of Roles**: Support services may be offered under different titles, such as digital navigators, digital ambassadors, and digital coaches.
5. **Diverse Populations**: They serve a wide range of populations, including people with disabilities, justice-impacted individuals, migrants, refugees, students, and caregivers<sup>1</sup>.


## Digital Navigator Model and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

The digital navigator model aligns well with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, addressing various levels of human motivation<sup>2</sup>(https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html)<sup>3</sup>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)<sup>4</sup>(https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760).

### Key Points

- **Physiological Needs**: Digital navigators help individuals meet basic needs by providing access to essential online services such as healthcare, food assistance, and housing resources.
- **Safety Needs**: By ensuring secure internet access and educating users on online safety, digital navigators contribute to a sense of security and stability.
- **Love and Belonging**: Digital navigators foster community connections by helping individuals stay in touch with family and friends, and participate in social networks.
- **Esteem**: Through digital literacy training and support, digital navigators empower individuals, boosting their confidence and self-esteem.
- **Self-Actualization**: By providing access to educational resources and opportunities for personal growth, digital navigators help individuals achieve their full potential.<sup>12</sup>

The model has been adapted by many organizations to meet the unique needs of their communities, demonstrating its versatility and importance in promoting digital inclusion.
