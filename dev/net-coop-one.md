## 🧠 Organizational / Cooperative Theory

### Collaborative Models
- **Teaming vs. takeover**: Emphasis on shared ownership and collaborative service delivery with districts.
- **ISD-level consolidation**: Merging of data centers and services across ISDs to reduce redundancy.
- **In-sourcing strategy**: Internal service provision to avoid private sector overhead and profit margins.
- **Shared service formulas**:
  - 50% student count
  - 50% device count
  - Variable helpdesk usage
  - Fixed engineering costs split evenly

### Governance & Trust
- **Local control**: Superintendents value direct relationships with tech directors.
- **Succession planning**: Systems designed to persist beyond individual leaders.
- **MAISA as cooperative vehicle**: Proposed intermediary for statewide engineering services.

### Equity & Funding
- **Disparities in tax base**: Rural districts face funding challenges due to lower local revenue.
- **Foundation allowance gaps**: State formula overlooks tech infrastructure needs.
- **Legislative engagement**: Advocacy to educate lawmakers on systemic funding gaps.

## 🌐 Network Infrastructure & Operations

### Enterprise-Grade Networks
- **High-capacity links**:
  - 20 Gbps connections between data center and districts
  - 10 Gbps inter-district links
- **Merged data centers**: Six centers consolidated for cost and operational efficiency.

### Failures & Risks
- **Loss of institutional knowledge**: Private sector poaching leads to outages.
- **Recent outages**: DNS issue caused multi-day data center failure.

### Cloud Migration
- **Proof of concept**: AWS migration via MiCloud.
- **Cost comparisons**: On-prem vs. cloud (e.g., $16,200/year for system hosting).
- **Operational savings**: Reduced engineering workload and improved security.

### Security & Scalability
- **Statewide SOC**: Proposed Security Operations Center for K-12 networks.
- **Pod computing vision**: Modular, scalable services managed by backend experts.

## 🔍 Key Challenges & Strategic Insights

- **Talent retention**: Public sector salaries can't compete with private industry.
- **Funding misalignment**: Districts spend ~3.5% on tech vs. industry standard of 7–11%.
- **Scaling cooperative models**: Flexibility needed for diverse district needs.
- **Legislative advocacy**: One-pager in development to communicate complex issues.
