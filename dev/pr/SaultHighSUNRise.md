## Sault Area High School Students Contribute to NASA’s SunRISE Solar Weather Research

**Sault Ste. Marie, MI** — Students at Sault Area High School are making waves in space science. As a participant in NASA’s **SunRISE Ground Radio Lab (GRL)**, the school is part of a national network of high schools helping monitor solar activity that could impact Earth’s technology infrastructure.

Sault Area High School is one of 18 schools nationwide selected to host a **dual dipole antenna system**, designed to detect **solar radio bursts**—early signals of geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting satellites, GPS navigation, and power grids. Students have been hands-on in assembling the antenna, conducting weekly data collection, and contributing to a growing scientific database used by researchers across the country.

> “Our students aren’t just learning about space, they’re helping monitor it,” said a school spokesperson. “This program connects classroom learning to real-world science in a way that’s both exciting and meaningful.”

The initiative, led by the **University of Michigan College of Engineering** and supported by **NASA’s SunRISE mission**, provides students with:
- Online training in **radio astronomy**
- Monthly webinars with **space scientists**
- A **NASA certificate** recognizing their contributions

More than **2,500 students** nationwide are involved in the project, which aims to improve forecasting of **space weather events** that can have serious consequences for modern technology.

Sault Area High School’s involvement underscores its commitment to **STEAM education** and its role in preparing students for careers in science, engineering, and technology.
