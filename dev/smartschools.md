Real-Life Examples of Smart Schools Using Advanced Technologies
Nimbin Central School: As part of the Smart Energy Schools Pilot Project, Nimbin Central School installed a 66 kW solar array and a 60 kWh battery. This system allows the school to generate its own power and store excess energy for later use. The project has not only reduced the school's energy costs but also provided students with a hands-on learning experience about renewable energy.
Weilmoringle Public School: This remote school installed a solar and battery system to test stand-alone off-grid renewable energy solutions. The system includes a 10 kW solar array and a 19 kWh battery, which ensures the school has a reliable power source even during grid outages. This project has improved the school's resilience and reduced its reliance on external power sources.
Middleton Tech School: This school in the UK implemented integrated access control and print management systems to cut down on energy usage. By automatically managing devices and turning off unused equipment, the school has seen noticeable improvements in energy efficiency.
Sault Ste. Marie Public Schools: As part of their ICT modernization plan, Sault Ste. Marie Public Schools are evaluating the use of Energy Efficient Ethernet to reduce power consumption. The plan includes replacing older switches with high-capacity ones and implementing smart PoE management to further trim energy waste.
River Grove Elementary (Lake Oswego SD): This school implemented a microgrid with 150 kW solar, 150 kWh batteries, and a generator (3-days fuel) that can run in island mode. They built it to withstand regional disasters and serve as a community shelter. They found additional benefits in cost savings and peak shaving in daily use.
