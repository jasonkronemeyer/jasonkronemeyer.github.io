# Visualization pipeline 

To integrate the visualization of spatial properties and relationships into a Shiny-like Python app and export the graphic as an SVG, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Integration Requirements
1. Identify key components in the [feedback.md file](https://github.com/jasonkronemeyer/jasonkronemeyer.github.io/blob/main/dev/feedback.md):
   - Ontology code
   - Properties explanation
   - Knowledge graph usage
   - Research documents
   - Internet infrastructure

2. Analyze how Shiny apps are structured in Python using Dash or other similar frameworks:
   - Dash by Plotly is a popular framework for building interactive web applications in Python, similar to Shiny in R.

3. Identify existing Python packages or libraries that can facilitate the integration:
   - `dash`: For creating interactive web applications.
   - `dash-leaflet`: For adding interactive maps.
   - `geopandas`: For handling spatial data.
   - `folium`: For creating maps.

### Step 2: Develop Integration Strategy
1. Create a mapping between the components in the feedback.md file and corresponding components in the Dash framework:
   - Ontology code: Define data structures and load data using `geopandas`.
   - Properties explanation: Define relationships and properties in the app layout.
   - Knowledge graph usage: Implement data manipulation and querying using Python libraries.
   - Visualization: Use `dash-leaflet` or `folium` for map visualization.

2. Draft code snippets or pseudocode for the integration:
   ```python
   import dash
   import dash_leaflet as dl
   import dash_html_components as html
   import geopandas as gpd

   # Load spatial data
   gdf = gpd.read_file('path_to_your_spatial_data.shp')

   # Initialize Dash app
   app = dash.Dash(__name__)

   # Define layout
   app.layout = html.Div([
       dl.Map(center=[latitude, longitude], zoom=10, children=[
           dl.TileLayer(),
           dl.GeoJSON(data=gdf.to_json())
       ])
   ])

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run_server(debug=True)
   ```

3. Identify potential issues or challenges and suggest solutions:
   - Data compatibility: Ensure spatial data is in a format compatible with `geopandas`.
   - Performance: Optimize data loading and map rendering for large datasets.

### Step 3: Create and Export Map as SVG
1. Install Required Packages:
   ```bash
   pip install folium geopandas matplotlib
   ```

2. Create and Export Map as SVG:
   ```python
   import folium
   import geopandas as gpd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Load spatial data
   gdf = gpd.read_file('path_to_your_spatial_data.shp')

   # Create a folium map
   m = folium.Map(location=[latitude, longitude], zoom_start=10)

   # Add GeoJSON data to the map
   folium.GeoJson(gdf).add_to(m)

   # Save the map to an HTML file
   m.save('map.html')

   # Plot using matplotlib
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='blue')
   plt.savefig('map.svg', format='svg')

   print("Map has been created and saved as map.html and map.svg.")
   ```

### Benefits of Saving as Both HTML and SVG
- **HTML**:
  - **Interactivity**: HTML maps created with libraries like `folium` are interactive, allowing users to zoom, pan, and click on features.
  - **Embedding**: HTML maps can be easily embedded into web pages and shared across different platforms.

- **SVG**:
  - **Scalability**: SVG files are vector graphics, which means they can be scaled infinitely without losing quality.
  - **Styling**: SVGs can be styled and manipulated with CSS and JavaScript, allowing for high customization.
  - **Print Quality**: SVGs are suitable for high-quality prints due to their resolution independence.

These formats complement each other by providing both interactive web-based visualization (HTML) and high-quality, scalable graphics (SVG).

# Shiny or Dash?

Based on the information from the `py-shiny` repository, here’s a comparison and analysis to determine if `py-shiny` can be used instead of Dash for your application:

### Step 1: Compare Features
- **Documentation**:
  - [py-shiny README](https://github.com/jasonkronemeyer/py-shiny/blob/main/README.md) highlights that Shiny for Python aims to build fast, beautiful web applications in Python, with resources like reactive programming and modules for large applications.
  - Dash is known for its comprehensive documentation and extensive support for interactive web applications with Plotly visualizations.

- **Core Features**:
  - `py-shiny`: Focuses on reactive programming and interactive visualizations, similar to its R counterpart.
  - Dash: Extensive support for interactive visualizations, integrates seamlessly with Plotly, and supports a wide range of components and interactive features.

- **Community and Support**:
  - `py-shiny`: Active development and community support, with resources available on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/yMGCamUMnS).
  - Dash: Large community and extensive support resources, including forums, tutorials, and documentation.

### Step 2: Analyze Integration Options
- **Spatial Data Visualization**:
  - `py-shiny`: While there is no direct mention of spatial data visualization plugins, Shiny for R has robust support for such features, which may be adapted for Python.
  - Dash: Includes `dash-leaflet` for interactive maps and geographic data visualization.

- **Ease of Integration**:
  - Both libraries aim to provide a seamless experience for building interactive applications. The choice may depend on your familiarity with the respective frameworks and the specific requirements of your project.

### Example: py-shiny Application
Here’s how you could integrate spatial data visualization into a `py-shiny` application:

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install shiny geopandas folium matplotlib
   ```

2. **Create a Shiny for Python App**:
   ```python
   from shiny import App, ui, render
   import geopandas as gpd
   import folium

   # Load spatial data
   gdf = gpd.read_file('path_to_your_spatial_data.shp')

   # Create a folium map
   m = folium.Map(location=[latitude, longitude], zoom_start=10)
   folium.GeoJson(gdf).add_to(m)
   m.save('map.html')

   # Shiny app layout
   app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
       ui.output_ui("map")
   )

   def server(input, output, session):
       @output
       @render.ui
       def map():
           return ui.HTML(f'<iframe src="map.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>')

   app = App(app_ui, server)
   ```
# R Libraries that export to SVG?

### Here are some R spatial visualization libraries that can export to SVG:

1. **ggplot2**: Use the `ggsave` function to save plots as SVG. Additional packages like `svglite` can provide more standards-compliant output. Refer to this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12226822/how-to-save-a-plot-made-with-ggplot2-as-svg) for details.

2. **svglite**: Provides more standards-compliant SVG output compared to the built-in `svg()` function. More information is available in this [R Graphics guide](https://r-graphics.org/recipe-output-vector-svg).

3. **sf package**: Commonly used for spatial vector data in R, which can be integrated with `ggplot2` for visualization and saved as SVG. Learn more in this [r-spatial tutorial](https://r-spatial.org/r/2024/06/26/sf-load-save.html).

These libraries and packages support creating and exporting spatial visualizations in SVG format.
