### 🧠 Key Takeaways
Blockchain is solving real-world problems in agriculture, logistics, and compliance.
U.S. risks falling behind without clear, supportive regulation.
Education and outreach are essential to demystify blockchain for rural communities.


The importance of digital connectivity, literacy, and skills, especially in the context of ensuring that rural communities are not left behind in the digital transformation enabled by blockchain and digital assets.

🔌 Digital Connectivity
Several witnesses and members of Congress emphasized that rural broadband infrastructure is essential for deploying blockchain-based tools in agriculture and rural development.
For example, Mark Tag (CattleProof Verified) and Mike Horton (Geodet Foundation) both highlighted that without reliable internet access, many of their blockchain-enabled solutions would be inaccessible to rural farmers and ranchers.
📚 Digital Literacy & Skills
There was a recurring theme around the need for education and outreach to help rural Americans understand and trust blockchain technology.
Mr. Tag specifically mentioned that blockchain and crypto can be intimidating to producers, and that tools should work in the background without requiring users to become tech experts.
Dr. Chris Brummer also emphasized the importance of making blockchain tools intuitive and user-friendly, so that people can benefit from them without needing deep technical knowledge.
🧠 Congressional Perspective
Members like Rep. Don Davis and Rep. Terri Sewell asked how to ensure that rural communities are included in the innovation wave, and how to educate both constituents and lawmakers about the benefits and practical applications of blockchain.
