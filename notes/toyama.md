Kentaro Toyama's research provides several compelling examples of how technology amplifies existing human and institutional forces rather than transforming them on its own. Here are a few key findings:

**Telecenters**: Toyama found that telecenters, which provide public access to computers and the internet, often fail to achieve their intended impact in communities with weak institutions. In areas with strong educational and social support systems, telecenters can enhance learning and connectivity [1](https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf).

**Television**: In his studies, Toyama observed that television can amplify educational efforts when used in conjunction with effective teaching methods. However, in environments lacking educational infrastructure, television alone does not significantly improve learning outcomes [1](https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf).

**Mobile Phones**: Toyama's research on mobile phones in developing countries showed that while mobile technology can facilitate communication and financial transactions (e.g., mobile banking), its benefits are maximized in regions with existing economic and social stability [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JdxjEQIAAAAJ&hl=en).

**ICT4D Projects**: Toyama's work in Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) highlights that technology projects are most successful when they support already effective development initiatives. For instance, mobile health applications work best when integrated into robust healthcare systems [2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JdxjEQIAAAAJ&hl=en).

These examples illustrate Toyama's central thesis that technology acts as an amplifier of existing conditions rather than a standalone solution to social problems [1](https://www.kentarotoyama.org/papers/Toyama%202011%20iConference%20-%20Technology%20as%20Amplifier.pdf)[2](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JdxjEQIAAAAJ&hl=en).
