### Function to Truncate LineStrings within a Polygon

This function takes two GeoDataFrames: one containing LineStrings and the other containing a Polygon. The function will truncate each LineString where it crosses outside the Polygon and remove the part of the LineString that is outside the Polygon.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import LineString, Polygon
from shapely.ops import split

def truncate_lines_within_polygon(lines_gdf, polygon_gdf):
    # Ensure the polygon GeoDataFrame contains only one polygon
    if len(polygon_gdf) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Polygon GeoDataFrame should contain exactly one polygon.")
    
    # Extract the polygon
    polygon = polygon_gdf.geometry.iloc[0]
    
    # Function to truncate a single LineString
    def truncate_line(line):
        intersection = line.intersection(polygon)
        split_lines = split(line, intersection)
        for segment in split_lines:
            if segment.within(polygon):
                return segment
        return None
    
    # Apply the truncation function to each LineString in the GeoDataFrame
    truncated_lines = lines_gdf.geometry.apply(truncate_line)
    
    # Create a new GeoDataFrame with the truncated lines
    truncated_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=truncated_lines)
    
    return truncated_gdf

# Example usage
# Create example GeoDataFrames
lines_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[LineString([(0, 0), (2, 2), (4, 4), (6, 6)])])
polygon_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[Polygon([(1, 1), (5, 1), (5, 5), (1, 5)])])

# Truncate the lines
truncated_gdf = truncate_lines_within_polygon(lines_gdf, polygon_gdf)
print(truncated_gdf)
```


This function will:
Ensure the polygon GeoDataFrame contains exactly one polygon.
Extract the polygon from the GeoDataFrame.
Define a helper function to truncate a single LineString.
Apply this helper function to each LineString in the lines GeoDataFrame.
Return a new GeoDataFrame containing the truncated LineStrings.

### Why Truncate?

Truncating a line string involves shortening or cutting down a line string geometry, which is typically used in spatial or GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications. A line string represents a sequence of connected points, forming a path or shape.

When you truncate a line string, you remove or "trim" parts of it—either from one or both ends—while keeping the remaining portion intact. This process is often used to adjust the length of a line string to fit specific requirements or constraints, such as a desired distance or spatial boundary.

For example, if you have a line string that represents a road or path, truncating it might involve cutting off the first 10 meters or the last 20 meters, depending on the context or desired result.
