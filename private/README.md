# private/

This directory is intentionally ignored by Git and is intended for local-only files, drafts, sensitive material, or temporary work-in-progress files that should not be committed to the repository.

Guidelines:

- Use this folder for videos, raw transcripts, editor backups, or local-only configuration files.
- Do not commit any files from this folder. It is listed in `.gitignore`.
- If you want a file added to the repo later, move or copy it out of this directory and add it explicitly.
