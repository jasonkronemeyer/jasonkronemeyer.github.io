# Digital Navigation & Maslow's Hierarchy
## A Community Development Framework

{:.lead}
Exploring the intersection of digital accessibility and human needs hierarchy in community development contexts.

**Author**: Jason Kronemeyer  
**Date**: May 2025  
**Research Status**: In Progress  
**Research Area**: Digital Equity & Community Development

## Research Overview

This research examines how the **Digital Navigator model** established by the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) aligns with **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**, providing a theoretical framework for understanding digital equity in community development contexts.

### **Research Questions**
1. How do digital navigation services address different levels of human needs?
2. What role does digital accessibility play in community development and human flourishing?
3. How can Maslow's framework inform more effective digital inclusion strategies?

## Key Findings

### **Digital Navigator Model Definition**
The National Digital Inclusion Alliance defines digital navigators as community-based supporters who provide:
- **Holistic Support**: Comprehensive, personalized assistance through ongoing interactions
- **Flexible Service Delivery**: Adaptable to various contexts and target populations
- **Diverse Roles**: Operating as digital coordinators, ambassadors, and coaches
- **Community-Centered Approach**: Serving tribal elders, seniors, people with disabilities, migrants, refugees, students, and caregivers

### **Alignment with Maslow's Hierarchy**

## Research Implications

### **For Community Development Practice**
- **Holistic Approach**: Digital inclusion must address multiple levels of human needs simultaneously
- **Progressive Support**: Services should build from basic access toward empowerment and growth
- **Community-Centered Design**: Programs must adapt to local contexts and population needs

### **For Digital Equity Policy**
- **Multi-Level Framework**: Policies should recognize the layered nature of digital inclusion
- **Sustainability Focus**: Long-term community relationships matter more than one-time interventions
- **Outcome Measurement**: Success metrics should reflect progress across the needs hierarchy
