## Abstract

This report provides a technical comparison of four distinct technologies: the **DuckDB spatial extension**, the **DuckDB inet extension**, **DuckLake**, and **Bayesian network analysis**. DuckDB's spatial extension integrates geospatial data types and operations into the DuckDB database system, enabling spatial joins, coordinate transformations, and GIS workflows within an in-process analytical database. DuckDB's inet extension introduces an IP address data type to efficiently handle IPv4/IPv6 data, supporting subnet arithmetic and containment for network traffic analysis. DuckLake is a new data lakehouse table format from DuckDB's creators, which stores metadata in traditional databases to achieve ACID transactions and fast metadata management, contrasting with file-based formats like Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Bayesian network analysis, a probabilistic modeling technique, is examined in terms of computational efficiency and its applications in decision support, diagnostics, and machine learning. For each technology, we evaluate performance benefits and use cases, include benchmarks or real-world examples, and compare them with alternative tools or methods.

## Key Findings

### ðŸš€ **Performance Highlights**
- **DuckDB Spatial**: ~60Ã— speedup over traditional approaches for large spatial joins (58M points with 310 polygons reduced from 30 minutes to 30 seconds)
- **DuckDB Inet**: Orders of magnitude faster than Python-based IP analysis for large datasets
- **DuckLake**: Faster metadata operations compared to Iceberg/Delta Lake, especially for frequent small updates
- **Bayesian Networks**: Real-time inference feasible for moderate-sized networks (dozens of nodes)

### ðŸ“Š **Comparative Analysis**
The research demonstrates how domain-specific optimizations can deliver significant efficiency gains:
- **Vectorized execution** in DuckDB leverages modern CPU architectures
- **Metadata optimization** in DuckLake reduces cloud storage overhead
- **Structural exploitation** in Bayesian networks manages computational complexity
