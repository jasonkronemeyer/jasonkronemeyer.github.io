 This masterclass will solidify your understanding of network infrastructure by demonstrating how to seamlessly integrate power and data delivery to the edge using Limited Energy Systems and Cabling. We'll explore a tiered design approach, from the core to the access layer, showcasing how to achieve unprecedented reach and efficiency. Learn how fiber with Fault Managed Power handles the "heavy lift" (100s Gb, kW, km), fiber with DC power manages the "middle lift" (10s Gb, 100s W, 100s m), and category cabling with PoE powers the "access layer" (Gbps, 10s W, 100+ m). We'll also highlight the transformative potential of Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) for extended reach applications (10Mb, 7W, 500m). Practical demonstrations of Layer 2 and Layer 3 equipment will be included. Discover how this centralized, converged strategy simplifies deployment, reduces costs, and future-proofs your network for the demands of IoT, smart buildings, and beyond.

 Discover how Fault Managed Power (FMP) opens a multi-billion-dollar heat pump market for low-voltage and network designers. Data centers are reshaping the digital world, but much of that work remains out of reach for most ICT professionals. At the same time, the shift from gas heating to electric heat pumps in buildings represents an equally large, yet far less recognized opportunity. FMP makes this market broadly accessible, enabling ICT professionals to play a central role. This Masterclass explores the drivers behind electrification, the costly barriers of traditional AC distribution, and why FMP is often the only practical way forward. Attendees engage with case studies, calculators, reference designs, and real-world lessons to build a framework for when FMP makes sense, when it doesn’t, and how to communicate the value to stakeholders. Participants leave with design knowledge, financial/market insights, and strategies to expand their scope in green building projects.

Outside plant cabling infrastructure has many associated costs that can make or break a project budget. Installation time is a key factor in not only cost but also meeting critical timelines. Time is money. Getting your fiber, and even composite cabling, from point A to point B can be more time-consuming than you might realize. There is a more efficient method that can reduce installation time, preserve duct space, and provide an efficient means to moves, adds, and changes in the outside plant. Air blown cable installation is a relatively new installation method in the US but is used as a proven installation solution in many parts of the world. This session will highlight the basics of outside plant installation using duct and air assistance. Whether you are considering air blown fiber solution for all or part of your next installation or just want to become familiar with the technology for future consideration, this session will address unknowns that you may have.
